Lay your gun to rest
Is this really what you want
To wonder where she is
To question every move.
If actions speak louder than words
I’m going deaf
Or
Maybe she’s a mute
She’s a mute
I stand in front of you
With my beating
Heart exposed
Dare I say you would
Leave me here to die alone
I’ve been
There through it all
When they turned their backs on you
And this is the
Thanks I get?
Or am I holding on
To promises you’ll never keep
Will you
Prove me wrong?
Prove me wrong
What would I have to do to show you that I
Would never leave you?
You’re just chasing shadows
Chasing
Shadows
Here’s my heart
It’s all yours
I will never leave you
I promise, I promise
I will always love you
I promise, I promise
