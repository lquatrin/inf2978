Just look what you've done!?
You've set the city to flames,
And the ghosts of this town
Have told me everything
Of all the masks we wear
To cover up all our lies
What're you so afraid of?
Why so scared?
These sirens are calling you home
You've forgot what it means to breathe
Dont let them get to your heart
Dont let them get to your soul
Beware the Vultures
Its time to stand your ground?
To let them know who are.
Dont ever back down
Oh my God, Ill give away everything to escape this place?
To save a sorry soul from such a shallow grave,
Well never make it out alive?
Well never, Well never, Well never make it out alive
Dont you dare
Tell me that youlove the attention
Of nothing but an empty room
This crowd is insatiable,
Theyre craving something new
I'll give you something to fight for,
Something to open your eyes
We're running to the gallows,
To hang this traitor high
Is this the end?
Of everything you love?
I hate to say I told so
But Im glad I did
Im so glad I did
I will show you fear in a
Handful of dust
Oh my God, Ill give away everything to escape this place
To save a sorry soul from a hollow grave,
Well never make it out alive
Well never, Well never, Well never make it out alive
