It's been over ten thousand minutes since you said good-bye
And I've thought about that moment at least a million times
You were standing at the kitchen counter with a single tear in your eye
The day you changed my life
Well I'm still going through the motions
Well I'm still taking in the air
Oh my heart's still beating
I'm still dreaming just like you were here
But something's wrong, something's missing
And it doesn't seem fair
I'm doing all that I can do to make it through
Well I'm still breathing but this ain't living
Without you
Well I can't smell the roses and the rainbow's just shades of grey
All those things that made me happy just don't move me the same
I can't help but remember us laughing and the way I held you every night
You made my whole world come alive
Well I'm still going through the motions
Well I'm still taking in the air
Oh my heart's still beating
I'm still dreaming just like you were here
But something's wrong, something's missing
And it doesn't seem fair
I'm doing all that I can do to make it through
Well I'm still breathing but this ain't living
Without you
Well I was minding my own business down at our favourite bookstore
Contemplating my own existence when you walked through that door
You asked how I was doing so I gave my best to lie
But I wanted so bad to tell you what I really felt inside
(Going through the motions)
Well I'm just taking in the air
Oh my heart's still beating
I'm still dreaming just like you were here
But something's wrong, something's missing
And it doesn't seem fair
I'm doing all that I can do to make it through
Well I'm still breathing but this ain't living
Without you
Well I'm still breathing but this ain't living
Without you
