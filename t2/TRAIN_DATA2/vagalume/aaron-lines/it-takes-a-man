She locked her fingers and bowed her head
She said I'm late, and I'm really scared
You can go, but I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it, either way
In my daddy's el camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man, to raise a child
I laid my head, down on the wheel
She said I know, I know, it don't seem real
She closed her eyes, tears flowed through
She said don't hate me, for loving you
In my daddy's el camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man, to raise a child
Well I could not reassure her
I couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just, took her hand
In my daddy's el camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I could see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man, to raise a child
It takes a man
