I knew it would happen someday
But I never thought that it? d be tonight
Then you walked into the bar with your new Mr. Right
With that big ol? chip on my shoulder
And Johnny Walker making me see red
I decided I? d walk right on over and pour him a beer
On his head
And I know I? ll regret this tomorrow
It? s just another cross that I? ll have to bare
I? m sober enough to know better
But I? m just drunk enough not to care
No, it? s not my proudest moment
But when he swung at my face and just missed
I decided there and then I? d introduce his chin to my right fist
Then I tipped my hat to my ex-girlfriend
Said Darlin? you sure look nice
For a low down cheatin? dead beatin? cold hearted witch
Who ruined my life
And I know I? ll regret this tomorrow
It? ll be another cross that I? ll have to bare
I? m sober enough to know better
But I? m just drunk enough not to care
Yeah I know I? ll regret this tomorrow
Cause Mr. Right? s finally comin? up for air
I? m sober enough to know better
But I? m just drunk enough not to care
I know I? ll regret this tomorrow
Instead of leavin? I sat back in my chair
I? m sober enough to know better
But I? m just drunk enough not to care
I? m just drunk enough not to care
