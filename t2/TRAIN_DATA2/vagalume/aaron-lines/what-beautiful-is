First time I saw you girl you lit up the room
How was I supposed to know
Beyond the way that your smile caught my eye
You had something deeper to show 
But the power of this emotion has revealed
Love is more then what I see, it's what I feel 
From the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
I've seen so many amazing things, still I was so blind
With your touch you opened up a world that I would have missed
You showed me what beautiful is 
It's in the way you can make me laugh
And in how you believe in me
How you follow your heart no matter what the path
And how you give so unselfishly 
Oh now I'm seeing colours where there once was only grey
Now I know the kind of love that takes my breath away 
From the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
I've seen so many amazing things, still I was so blind
With your touch you opened up a world that I would have missed
You showed me what beautiful is, yeah 
Well the most amazing thing by far
Is you don't even know how beautiful you are 
From the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
Well I've seen so many things, amazing things, still I was so blind
With your touch you opened up a world that I would have missed
You showed me what beautiful is 
Darlin' you are what beautiful is
What beautiful is
