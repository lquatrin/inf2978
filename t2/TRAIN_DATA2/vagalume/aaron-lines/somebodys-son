I was watching the news tonight
Anchor man said there was a fight 
And a young man died from his wounds 
They showed pictures of the battle 
And I almost turned the channel 
Like I always seem to do 
Then it hit me like a freight train coming through (that's) 
Somebody's son 
Somebody's husband 
Somebody's everything 
Out there 
Someone's coming undone 
It made me wonder if anyone really wins 
When every war has to be won with 
Somebody's son 
I walked down the hall to check 
On my youngest lying in bed 
And I stood there watching him dream 
I tried but I couldn't imagine 
How it would feel if something happened 
And I didn't have him here with me 
Then I cried for that dead boy and his family (cause he's) 
Somebody's son 
Somebody's husband 
Somebody's everything 
Out there 
Someone's coming undone 
It made me wonder if anyone really wins 
When every war has to be won with 
Somebody's son
