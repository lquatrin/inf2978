well, i don't claim to know everything
but some things aren't hard to figure out
i can tell your love for me has been fading
and i know what you wanna to talk about
cause i can read your heart, it wants to say goodbye
i can read your heart like an open book
it's written in your arms, they no longer hold me tight
and what you're about to say is tearing me apart
so don't start, baby, i can read your heart
i felt it skip a beat on the night we met
moving cautiously at first, then letting go
yeah, with each passing day, i turned another page
so there ain't much i don't already know
cause i can read your heart, it wants to say goodbye
i can read your heart like an open book
it's written in your arms, they no longer hold me tight
and what you're about to say is tearing me apart
so don't start, baby, i can read your heart
well, i knew this day was coming, it was there between the lines
still i was hoping maybe i could change your mind
but that's not gonna happen, no way upon this earth
so just kiss me one last time, but don't say a word
cause i can read your heart, it wants to say goodbye
i can read your heart like an open book
it's written in your arms, they no longer hold me tight
and what you're about to say is tearing me apart
so don't start, baby, i can read your heart
so don't start, baby, i can read your heart
