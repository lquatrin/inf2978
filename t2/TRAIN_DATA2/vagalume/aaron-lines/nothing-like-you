I've seen the sunset from the top of a mountain,
And I've walked the streets of Kathmandu
I've seen a sky so full of stars, I couldn't count them
But i ain't never seen nothing like you
I've felt forgiveness looking out over the ocean
I've been lonely in a cheap motel
I've felt lovers gently brush against my sin
But I ain't never felt nothing like you
You, you're too beautiful for words,
You, move me so much it hurts,
Never had something I was so afraid to lose,
Never had nothing like you
I would give away all of my tomorrows
Let my soul turn black and blue
Just to spend one night lost in your arms
Cause I ain't never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you
