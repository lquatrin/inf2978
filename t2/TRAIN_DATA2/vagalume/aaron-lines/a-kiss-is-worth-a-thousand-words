she said, i don't even know you anymore
we're barely friends, we used to be lovers
i remember when i was all that you were living for
now, we're just living in this house, like strangers
i tried to give to you, everything i thought you ever wanted
to make this house a home
you still lay next to me, but all i feel is alone
how can i make you see
that a kiss is worth a thousand words
a thousand love songs, and a thousand roses
can't change the way i miss being reassured
when you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mine
if you really wanna tell me that you love me
want your feelings to be heard
a kiss is worth a thousand words
he just sat there on the couch looking surprised
he couldn't believe what he was hearing
it was like she'd opened up his heart and reached inside
and told him everything that he was feeling
he said, i tried to give to you, everything i thought you ever wanted
been working day and night
i felt this distance too, but i never knew just what to say
to make it right
till you said, a kiss is worth a thousand words
a thousand love songs, and a thousand roses
can't change the way i miss being reassured
when you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mine
if you really wanna tell me that you love me
want your feelings to be heard
a kiss is worth a thousand words
in the middle of the night, they finally got it right
when they both closed their eyes, and talked for hours
he told her that he loved her, that he couldn't live without her
but not a single heart was broken, not a single word was spoken
oooh yeah, just one kiss
one single kiss
whoa, a kiss is worth a thousand words
a thousand love songs, and a thousand roses
can't change the way i miss being reassured
when you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mind
if you really wanna tell me that you love me
want your feelings to be heard
yeah, if you really wanna tell someone you love 'em
want your feelings to be heard
