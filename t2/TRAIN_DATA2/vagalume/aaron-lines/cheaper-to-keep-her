Your down on your luck
You just lost your truck
You cant afford another beer
Your credit cards don't work
Whole world thinks you're a jerk
You wondering how you wound up here
It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
Now your sleeping on the couch
At your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so
It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
So if you're thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
She's gonna serve ya papers
Make ya pay through the nose
And when her lawyer gets through
With you you'll have to move to
Mexico
It wouldn't been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn't been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living
With an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
