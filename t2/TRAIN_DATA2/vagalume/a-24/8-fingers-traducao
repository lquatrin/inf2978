One, I'm ready for two
Too many, three, four
I'm out before the count, you know that
Five, this work keeps me alive
And don't forget six, seven and eight
You know!
I've only got eight fingers
Won't get any bigger
Never need a trigger
I've told you so
I won't get any taller
Smaller 'cos it's alright
Yeah, we're moving on
Yeah, we're moving on
Yeah, I'm ready for the crowd
Give me some noise
I'm taking it hard
I'm shaking on, yeah
I'm ready for the crowd
You know!
I've only got eight fingers
Won't get any bigger
Never need a trigger
I've told you so
I won't get any taller
Smaller 'cos it's alright
Whoah, you know
I've only got eight fingers
Won't get any bigger
Never need a trigger
I've told you so
I won't get any taller
I'm only getting smaller
'Cos it's alright
