Bow to the master that feeds on your weakness
that is eating you now. Feel the disaster,
chemical Priest, preaching chemical hell.
Rejected are all those who stand in alliance.
Cast into pits of eteranal flame!
Instantly placed in the world of dejected,
engulfing your soul...
Demon!
I choose my victims Randomly. i don't give a fuck who you are!
Your end comes unexpectedly!
A mad attack...Destructing!
I hover above the body, I only see in black
and white. The taste of death i just discovered
i snap your neck with all my might!
Satisfied, I gloat with laughter, stagnant body robbed
of life! Deleting problems instantly, I ree the soul from
spreading.
White death, death's breath possessed!
Torture..Torture..Torture..Torture!
