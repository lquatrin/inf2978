A New World of chaos has been born
An impossible world made by you
Fading light through windows
And the passage far beyond
Be truly as the mind goes
Be truly when you’re gone
Atmospheric dark legion of feelings
Created an indescribable feeling
A waterfall of red tears…
Some of what was once held
Has been severely misplaced
Lost somewhere between
My hand and the wall
Being submissive to my consciousness
I try to discover why the emotion
Always try to analyse the regret
Being faithful to the divinity of life.
… I can’t focus on anything close to me
Only the ground below my feet
Lost in my blood red tears…..
