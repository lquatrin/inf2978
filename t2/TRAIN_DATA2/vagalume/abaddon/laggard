Where is the end of my dream?
Looking for it forever?
Where is the reality lost in our music..?
The importance of music
Making it feel so real
Intentions of the vibes
Richly ejected into our veins
Where was the time that?
We could spend time together
Analysing how music was defined:
A drug forever falling
A time where your life stood still
And mine continued in other
Dimensions of the world being....
More peaceful at the time.
Liberation of my destiny
In simplicity and dignity
I decided to be my own leader
I decided being my own saviour
I decided to be my own strength that carries
Once I will make you see
I will make it happen
I will be the one left standing
Finding back the reality…………..lost in our music...
