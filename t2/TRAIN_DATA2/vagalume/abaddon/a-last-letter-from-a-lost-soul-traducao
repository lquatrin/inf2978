The knowledge of the knife was already obvious
It reaches deep in the heart
Never thought, never expected…never wanted
It happened from a lost soul
A soul full of chaos, years ago
Rest had been found, but anguish was awaiting
Anguish of being hurt again
Anguish of being hit again
Stability could never be a solution
A solution could never end in stability
A circle so endless, a circle impossible to break
Last message
Going back to chaos
Leaving the one and only
And never going back
To times and places where
Rest was found…
A last letter from an individual
Who lost self-confidence?
Confidence in life, beauty ness and honesty
Always being isolated between that wall
The damn wall of protection
