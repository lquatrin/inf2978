Dragged through the pain once again
From this I'll gladly perish
Dragged through the pain once again
Hopeless from this I'll gladly perish
Meaningless growth in these scars of your fucking regrets
Torture drowning... Choking beneath the surface of wrath,
led through the darkness guided by the soothing hate
From this unwanted existence I'll gladly perish
Dragged through the pain once again
From this I'll gladly perish...
