I'm a boy with a heavy heart, it's a burden in my
chest.
and to be honest right now, it's not working the best.
i'm a boy with a steady start, this time i'll do what
i should.
you always had faith that i would.
i'm not a master of words,
and i don't wanna go about this wrong.
so i'll write another song about you.
do me a favor and make this easy for me,
cause i don't know what to say
and i'm afraid that i'll say anything.
do me a favor and don't cry over me tonight,
cause i think you'll be alright
i think that you'll survive.
i am having trouble speaking up, this is just as hard
for me.
and if you'll let me explain, i'm sure you will agree.
i wish your eyes weren't glaring back at me,
it's worse that you look perfect tonight.
i've gotta get my head on straight, i think i'll be
alright.
i'm not a master of words,
and i don't wanna go about this wrong.
so i'll write another song about you.
do me a favor and make this easy for me,
cause i don't know what to say
and i'm afraid that i'll say anything.
do me a favor and don't cry over me tonight,
cause i think you'll be alright
i think that you'll survive.
