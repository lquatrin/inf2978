listen well and take notes.
you're the enemy the end of me is coming close.
and at my death scene, they'll fill the iv.
wait, no don't, fill the iv.
i write the words that make the whole world cry.
you usually provide the story line.
i sing this melody,
and you're the only thing that makes me.
swallow my pride and throw up my dignity.
i'm breaking hearts while breaking guitar strings.
(breaking hearts while breaking guitar strings)
i'm sending songs in telegrams that can't sing.
i'm sending envelopes with no stamps or posting.
i'm selling out and i haven't sold anything.
you have no idea how much i want this.
every part of me screams you know you want this.
i'm so fake i can't stand the deceit in this.
every part of me screams you know you want this.
i write the words that make the whole world cry.
you usually provide the story line.
i sing this melody,
and you're the only thing that makes me.
swallow my pride and throw up my dignity.
i'm breaking hearts while breaking guitar strings.
