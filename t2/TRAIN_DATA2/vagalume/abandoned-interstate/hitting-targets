Forgive me, I'm terribly apologetic.
I'm sorry things aren't turning out your way.
But life is too short to deal with apathy,
because feeling sorry isn't for me.
I'm not feeling sorry.
(But there's this other guy) I hope he's perfect.
(I wanna cry tonight) I hope it's worth it.
(I hope you're not upset) I must be jumping for joy.
This target's hit, and i'm settling scores.
Forgive me, I'm terribly apologetic.
I'm sorry things aren't going quite as planned.
But life is too short, and mine is falling fast.
I'm done with lingering on everything in the past.
I'm done with feeling sorry.
(But there's this other guy) I hope he's perfect.
(I wanna cry tonight) I hope it's worth it.
(I hope you're not upset) I must be jumping for joy.
This target's hit, and i'm settling scores.
