i've got such high standards, and such inadequate results.
i've got these problems with words, and taking my time doesnt work.
and the result is as you see it, here i am.
and the result is as you read it, here's the product of my adolescence.
take time, just take time.
take time, just take time.
well patience is not something i am into,
and i think it's fair to say that i have waited long enough.
this equation should not be, a sole value of me.
and i think it's fair to say, i deserve this.
i've got such a reputation, for letting things pass me by.
i've got the worst frame of sight, in this relationship frame of mind.
and the result is as i see it, here i am.
and the result is as you read it, here's the product of my loneliness.
take time, just take time.
take time, just take time.
well patience is not something i am into,
and i think it's fair to say that i have waited long enough.
this equation should not be, a sole value of me.
and i think it's fair to say, i deserve this.
Take time, Just.
