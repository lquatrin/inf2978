I couldn't write a better note.
so this will just have to do.
cause you wouldnt know just how hard it is to settle
with the I before the you and a heart in the middle.
but simple words are easy to write.
it's so easy to lie and make believe what we're saying is right.
do you honestly believe that it's true.
that we're meant to be and Im the only guy for you?
maybe you do.
these are just words written on a paper.
does this mean anything at all?
this is my last hope to try to convince her.
as if words meant anything at all.
cause its so easy to lie and make believe that we're right.
cause it's so easy to lie and make believe that we're right.
I couldn't find a better line, 
so this will just have to do.
cause words are so definitive and emotions are not.
and darling you're the most indefinite on the whole damn block.
isn't that a shock.
so take this message as
a reminder to keep an eye out.
cause you never know when i might leave something outside your window.
you never know when i might leave my heart on your doorstep.
