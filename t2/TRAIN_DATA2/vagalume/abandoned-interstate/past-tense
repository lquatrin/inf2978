I've been known to use the past tense,
cause I'm never quite sure about now.
You see, I'm in between the barriers 
of where I wanna be and where I am.
And I know I need to breathe in,
but i feel like my breath's running low.
I'd just like for you to come home again.
Cause I can't be alone for this long,
and function like I should.
And I can't lie about what I've done wrong,
but I can do good.
And you may not agree,
but you had no right to leave.
(you had no right to leave.)
I'm a hopeless kind of sentence,
with mistakes in the proper form.
I'm a mess, I'm a wreck,
I'm unfortunately staying like this.
And I know that I should straighten up,
but it's so hard to grasp onto something real,
when all I had, all I want, and all I've ever made,
will never be seen again.
Cause I can't be alone for this long,
and function like I should.
And I can't lie about what I've done wrong,
but I can do good.
And you may not agree,
but you had no right to leave.
(you had no right to leave.)
