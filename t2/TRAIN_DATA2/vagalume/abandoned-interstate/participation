Spent alot of my time trying to figure out,
where I'm going and exactly what I'm all about,
and my story is very typical.
So I figured I would make this go out to
everyone who has someone like you.
Cause we're nothing special,
this is typical.
So if you'd open up your window,
and hear them yell at you,
cause I'm telling them to
Sing in chorus,
I'm better off without you.
Now scream your lungs out,
everything they've said is true.
I'm better off without you.
You'll never find my letters, the hardest part's the end.
The "I love you, sincerely me, and from your best friend"
never fit the situation that i'm in with you.
So i figured I woud throw them all away,
condense everything I've ever had to say,
and write it in this song for you to hear.
So if you'd like to lend an ear,
there's a crowd of kids who would like to help me
Sing in chorus,
I'm better off without you.
Now scream your lungs out,
everything they've said is true.
I'm better off without you.
Whoaa, (whoaa)
Now sing in chorus,
I'm better off without you.
Now scream your lungs out,
everything they've said is true,
I'm better off without you.
Now sing in chorus,
I'm better off without you.
Now scream your lungs out,
everything they've said is true,
I'm better off without you.
