My body's trembling
Passion's got control on me
There's no way to deny it
My body's yearning completely
Girl can't you tell that i am proceeding is driving me crazy
Can you endure the best of what you've been waiting for
I've got what you want
I feel your desire for me (yeeaahh)
You've got what i need
I'm submissive to you
Take control of me
It's now or never
Prove yourself to me
I aint goin nowhere
Take your time with me (your time your time)
So get ready or not
*Chorus*
(are you ready?)
Ready or not here I come
(Im going down) I'm going down on
The one that keeps me happy
I love you baby, yes i do
(are your ready?)
Ready or not here i come
I'm going down on
The one who do her thang for me
You the only one that i want to go down on baby
(heeyy)
There's not much for us to talk about (oh yea)
It's either yay or nay
That's all that matters now
Let's not waste this time
Just stop the moment or give me mine
Cuz joy is all you bring
And going down on you aint nothing but a thing
I've got what you want
I feel your energy for me
You've got what I need
I'm submissive to you
Take control of me
It's now or never
Prove yourself to me
I aint goin nowhere
So take your time with me (your time, your time)
So get ready or not
*Chorus x4*
