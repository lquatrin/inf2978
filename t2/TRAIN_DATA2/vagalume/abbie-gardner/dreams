I am always running, living on in-betweens
I wear my dreams around my neck, as if someone could see
Wondering what I've been doing, am I where I should be
But all my blues turn to red when you look at me
 
So I'll sit right here with you tonight
forget about all I've done wrong and all I've done right
Cause I know you will love me
even if I never catch up to these dreams I've been chasing
 
I am always thinking about what I didn't do
Counting up my failures by the light of the moon
I know I'm getting older and you are too
But the one thing I am sure of is that I love you
