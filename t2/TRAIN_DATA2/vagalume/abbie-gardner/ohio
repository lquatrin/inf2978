I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go to OHIO
Seeds to sow, rows to hoe, I gotta go to OHIO
 
When I was three I planted seeds
Watched â€˜em grow up past my knees
Long for dirt between my toes
Dirt that comes from OHIO
 
I remember corn so high
Poked a hole up in the sky
Tickled god's toes until he cried
OHIO has corn that high
 
I grew up and moved away
Can't believe I didn't stay
I'll return one happy day
I gotta go to OHIO
