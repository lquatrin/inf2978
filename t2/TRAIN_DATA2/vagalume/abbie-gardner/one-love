You take ten thousand tears
collected over 26 years
You take a million lonely days
run together in a drunken haze
You take half a dozen heartaches
and eight apartments with 2nd hand clothes
God knows how you take it, replace it,
with one love
 
You take seven hundred sleepless nights
twice as many useless fights
You take dirty disappointment 
over dreams that died
You found the fragile light behind my fear
the hidden words that no one else could hear
 
I had half a heart in a bag of bones
Hopes cut off and turned to stone
Dried up tears soaked in my skin
I thought I'd never love again
My pieces were just floating round
â€˜til you took them
and you made me whole somehow
You gave me one love
