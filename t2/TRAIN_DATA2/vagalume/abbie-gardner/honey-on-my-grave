When I, am long gone          
And I'm cold beneath the clay
Won't you think of this old song
And put honey on my grave
If I'm covered in sweetness
I surely will be saved
I will live in the golden sun
With honey on my grave
 
Don't need no flowers
I don't need no stone
You can burn me up or bury me whole
I worked this bitter ground all of my days
I believe I've earned some honey on my grave
 
Sister, don't you mourn me
From heaven I will wave
I don't need no wailing wall
With honey on my grave
