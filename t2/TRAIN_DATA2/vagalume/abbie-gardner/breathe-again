Just a simple girl in these shoes
They ain't worth much
but they carry the weight of my blues
Just a lonely voice, with too much inside
I ache to let it all out
But I've got too much to hide
 
So take me down to the river
Drive me way up North
Let's go where we can take it easy
Leave our troubles behind
And breathe again
 
You say that you feel old
You've got the weight of the world in your hands
You say you wake up tired
Drag yourself through the day
But you can't even remember why
 
So I'll take you down to the river
Drive you way up North
Let's go where we can take it easy
Leave our troubles behind
And breathe again
Got to breathe again
