Behind the gates only death
Burning your mind you hear the bell
The gates are open for your entry
Light of day turn to the darkness of hell
Nightmare
Skull and putrid corpses
Sads and somber places
And you cry tears of blood
Because you are dead
Now I will go prowl on endless night
Remembering yours blasphemes and lies
I will never give mercy to you
But satanas want your sinner's soul
You will never return
Never
