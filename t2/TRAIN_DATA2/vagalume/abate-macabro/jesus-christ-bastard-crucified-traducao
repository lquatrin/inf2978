March to the church
To find the bastard christ
To fuck and destroy him
And his followers too
Nailed and tortured
Your pain delights me
Fury in my eyes
Hate in my heart
I hate your lies
Blasphemies in your temple
And no more mercy
I kill for my own believes
Your body is rotten
My hate slashes you all
Battles against christ
Sanguinary and without piety
Sinners die with your lord
Jesus christ bastard crucified
Your bowels exposed
Your blood wells
I want more
I want war
Jesus christ bastard crucified
March to the church
To find the bastard christ
To fuck and destroy him
And his followers too
Nailed and tortured
Your pain delights me
Fury in my eyes
Hate in my heart
I hate your lies
Blasphemies in your temple
And no more mercy
I kill for my own believes
Your body is rotten
My hate slashes you all
Battles against christ
Sanguinary and without piety
Sinners die with your lord
Jesus christ bastard crucified
Burning
Burning
Burning bastard
Burning bastard christ
Bastard christ crucified
Burning
