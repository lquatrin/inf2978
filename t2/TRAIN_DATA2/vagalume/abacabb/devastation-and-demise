Why do we suffer? Why do we feel anguish.
I have seen it all way to closely.
I have felt it all way to recently.
Is it all really worth the battle,
This force will only leave behind a 
Devastation of blood and demise.
Why wait just to have everything end anyway?
I won..t let myself live in regret.
We lament the deaths of our loved ones,
But who is to say they are not better off.
I know it would improve my biography
We will assemble on another day, in another life.
I will see you soon
