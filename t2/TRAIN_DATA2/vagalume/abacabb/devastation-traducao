Why do we suffer?
Why do we feel anguish?
I have seen it all way too closely
I have felt it all way to recently
Is it all really worth the battle?
This force will only leave behind a devastation of blood and demise
Why wait just to have everything end anyway?
I wont let myself live in regret
We lament the deaths of our loved ones but who is to say that they are not better off?
I know it would improve my biography
We will assemble on another day, in another life
I will see you soon
