I am lost for words
This is a science
I have my own techniques
Things wont be the same again
None of you can stop me now
Thing wont ever be the same again
I drowned myself out
Realism and time has been gone for years
Everything that was keeping me here is destroyed
I know the hardest part for you is to watch me do this to myself but you have to step back
I have control of everything you have to step back
I have control of everything so sit the fuck back
Things wont ever be the same again
I am lost for words
I wont come down from this high
None of you can stop me now so just sit the fuck back and observe
Destruction
It is time for my destruction
