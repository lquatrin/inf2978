Why would I take care of you?
Everyone around you, they keep drifting away
Why would I take care of you?
Youve got nothing left and I got nothing to say
So wheres all this faith and confidence?
I think its your imagination
Will you take this to hell?
Youre not the same
Its an addiction, cant you admit it?
I cant keep watching, you keep drifting away
I cant look in the mirror without thinking that I came from you
I have been consumed with lost memories and long sleepless nights, its all because of you
You take more and more
Its always one more try
Always coughing up another excuse
If you dont stop now, youre never going to be the same person I knew
Blood is the only thing that keeps us biological
And I would drain my body of every ounce just to get rid of you
So wheres all your faith and confidence?
I think its your imagination
Conflicted and addicted
This shit is just as I predicted
Conflicted and still addicted, yet somehow you still cant admit it
This is an addiction and no one can change it but you
