You selfish bitch, how could you do this to me?
You selfish bitch, you will regret this
You have left me to fend for myself in a world I have never had to live alone
You have left me to fend for myself in a world I have never had to let go
What has happened to us?
Is this just a long goodbye?
What will I become?
What will this make of me?
This sickness has engulfed me
My sanity is lost and my true identity revealed
Dont speak of our history
I dont want anything to do with you
You are fucking dead to me
