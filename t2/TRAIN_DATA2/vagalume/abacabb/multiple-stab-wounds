you're killing yourself slowly, but I can do it much faster. 
a seperation of words like the seperation of each of your spinal segments. i am trying as hard as i can to break through these walls. i am panning gold through this rib cage. i will not be shot down. multiple stab wounds in the shape of your favorite constellation. there won't be a scar until this bleeds first i have come to the realization that death is a serious matter so quit joking around before I tie a knot in your jugular vein with my teeth. i will stay alive long enough to rip my organs from my body and throw them at your feet.
