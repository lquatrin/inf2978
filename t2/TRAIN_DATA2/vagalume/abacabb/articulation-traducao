Don’t wait for me, this might take a while
I will live my life to the fullest extent
I won’t live life by the books
I am in a state of destitution. I don’t have
Much to live for. You are my life, you are golden
The articulation of these bones isn’t strong enough
This encephalon can only hold so much, and
The psychological result of perception and reasoning
Is way too much for you to handle. I know what needs
To be done. I can do it on my own. However
I require that you are there with me
All I ask is that you wait for me, because
This might take a while
