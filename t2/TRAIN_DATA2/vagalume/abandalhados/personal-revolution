Every and each day I spend
I keep on searching for something worth fighting for
But now I can see, the true revolution depends upon me
Now it`s the right time to change
There`s an evolution happening to me
It makes me stronger, it`s all I need
The personal revolution
Ohohhhh
The personal revolution
It`s needed to change our way of thinking
Feeling and how to react
Results will be achieved much fester then what you`d expect
