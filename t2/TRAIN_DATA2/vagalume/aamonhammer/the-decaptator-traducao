Insanity or not
I pray for the death
There are a lot of
Unfortunates outward
I'll kill then all
My pleasure is take
The life of anybody
My weapons are sharpened
Ready to put out your bowels
Cause I'm the decaptator
My hammer claims for blood
I'll be your hangman
I'll decaptate them all
I'll pluck off your heads
I'll throw you
On the lap of your mothers
And I spit on your faces
I'll salute the death
Drinking your blood
I'll had realize
My insane justice
Cry out my sweet victim
While I feel satisfaction
Plucking of each organ
Of your body
