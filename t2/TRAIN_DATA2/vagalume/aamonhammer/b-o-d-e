B.O.D.E. 
The man live between god and the devil 
Between the creator and the destroyer 
The man can to choose, because 
There's a two ways 
Satan finished with the innocence of the man. 
Revealed the secret to the good and evil. 
Fallen angel, the saints cursed your name 
Lucifer, father of disgrace 
Belzebu the opresser damn it by your evil. 
Satan lord of this dirty reality 
The prince that break the bone of the hope 
And blind the eyes of the men 
That think to be wises but, 
They're only your priests and slaves 
Fools that make dirty his hand with blood. 
He know the prophecy and know 
That his time is short 
And with wrath he will to send the beast 
For to press the good man 
Then all people will to see that 
The prophecy will to be accomplish 
And you'll see the triumph of good
