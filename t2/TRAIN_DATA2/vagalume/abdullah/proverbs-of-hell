So I pray now to the mother of all lies
Under the holy mountain, I see through her disguise
In the smoke of the afterlife, I dream with fallen gods
Chastised by heathen eyes, our human form is lost
I dream of time
And the withering of all mankind
In anguish sleep
Silently
The stench of life clings to my flesh
The redemption of my soul brings rest
Will the rapture ever cease
Will the visions die
Enjoy the solace found in the absence of mankind
So I dream now with the spirits of the lost
Divine hallucinations, I am one with the gods
Under the holy ground, my energy survives
Exhale the breath of life in the hall of empty eyes
I dream of time
And the withering of all mankind
In anguish sleep
Silently
Sometime near the end
I traveled amongst unknown men
They drug me
They bring peace
I will call the earth my home
I will follow where the shadows may roam
I dream of time
And the withering of all mankind
In anguish sleep
Silently
I dream of time
And the withering of all mankind
In anguish sleep
Silently
The stench of life clings to my flesh
The redemption of my soul brings rest
Will the rapture ever cease
Will the visions die
Enjoy the solace found in the absence of mankind
Sometime near the end
I traveled amongst unknown men
They drug me
They bring peace
I will call the earth my home
I will follow where the shadows may roam
So I pray now to the mother of all lies
Under the holy mountain, I see through her disguise
In the smoke of the afterlife, I dream with fallen gods
Chastised by heathen eyes, our human form is lost
