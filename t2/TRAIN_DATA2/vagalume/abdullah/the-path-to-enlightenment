Strange are the things we place our beliefs in
My apprehensions tear down the walls of the temple
The dollar signs that you crave
Mark the extent of your faith
Strange are the things we choose to believe in
My apprehensions tear down the walls of the temple
I'll never fit in, no faith to believe in
My resignation tears down the walls of the temple
Your cash betrays your true worth
Obtain your garden on Earth
Profane is the wealth that you believe in
Since you can't be wrong, shield your eyes from the sun
Its light will expose the poverty of your soul
Your wealth cannot save
This sacrament that will fade
Your opulence has no worth
You've sold your soul on this earth
And I'll break from your hold
My life cannot be bought and sold
This truth you will never get
And now you're so far in debt
And I'll break from your hold
My life cannot be bought and sold
This truth you will never get
