All life moves closer to death
Hold on to just one last breath
We don't know what time holds
Do you fear what's out there
We cling to the things of this earth
Trace your steps back to your birth
We don't know what time holds
We can't face this one fate
So I pray
One more day
I feel the pain, hold on to me in the night
I feel alive, don't let it end, give me life
Does time move in a straight line
I'll stand still or lag behind
Count the days till your fate
Hold on to what kills you
I'll awake
One more day
I feel the pain, hold on to me in the night
I feel alive, don't let it end, give me life
I can never walk away, I'm caught here forever
You can never follow me expecting to fly
All I've ever dreamed about is leaving forever
I am like the serpent who tries to devour itself
I feel the pain, hold on to me in the night
I feel alive, don't let it end, give me life
I feel the pain, hold on to me in the night
I feel alive, don't let it end, give me life
I can never walk away, I'm caught here forever
You can never follow me expecting to fly
All I've ever dreamed about is leaving forever
I am like the serpent who tries to devour itself
