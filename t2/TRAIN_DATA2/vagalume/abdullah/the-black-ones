Walk the path of the righteous ones, yeah
Don't come home to pray
Been on my feet for ten days now, baby
Just follow me, take my hand
The Black Ones will shine on tonight
The Black Ones will rise to new heights
The Black Ones will shine on tonight
The Black Ones will suffer through life
Can you talk with the demons, honey
Fall on mortal knees
Speak in tongues with the ones you love now
Drink with the spirits that have blessed you
The Black Ones will rise to new heights
The Black Ones will suffer through life
The Black Ones, their souls will thrive
The Black Ones will shine on tonight
The Black Ones will rise to new heights
The Black Ones will suffer through life
The Black Ones, their souls will thrive
The Black Ones will shine on tonight
