The sun sets for the final time, the night feels fine
And we walk in the distant shadows to the end of time
We are one with the moonlit ocean, it ignores our sins
Baptized in its healing waters, the new world now begins
It says, hold on, hold on now to the things that seem unreal
Don't let go of the love you feel
Yeah, I watched the sun die today
I sat alone as the light slipped away
And I know the earth becomes mine today, yeah
And the moon still shines from so far away
The love that keeps me here will never disappear
I won't fade away
And the earth and sea are mine
The sun may never shine
I won't fade away
The sun sets for the final time, the night feels fine
And we walk in the distant shadows to the end of time
We are one with the moonlit ocean, it ignores our sins
Baptized in its healing waters, the new world now begins
It says, hold on, hold on now to the things that seem unreal
Don't let go of the love you feel
Yeah, I watched the sun die today
I sat alone as the light slipped away
And I know the earth becomes mine today, yeah
And the moon still shines from so far away
The love that keeps me here will never disappear
I won't fade away
The earth and sea are mine
The sun may never shine
I won't fade away
Hope will live on, within this love song
I know it's not real, yeah
The earth will still spin and time cannot end
I know it's not real
Hope will live on, within this love song
I know it's not real, yeah
The earth will still spin and time cannot end
I know it's not real
