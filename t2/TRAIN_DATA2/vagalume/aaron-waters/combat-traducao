Tick tock, tick tock
You're runnin' out of time
No time to stop
'Cause they are close behind
When they come knock
They better know it's time
I've got the lock
To keep them all in line
Well you can run and you can hide
When the evil's got you in sight
Cu-ca-com Combat
Cu-ca-com Combat
Now you see them
The plan is very clear
Find their weak spot
And never show your fear
They think their tough
But you've got a secret weapon
They don't know 'bout
Your ultra zord protection
And now they run and now they hide
'Cause you're on the winning side
