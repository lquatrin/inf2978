No, We cannot see
Who are we, to look to
No, it cannot hear
What is to believe in
And we keep dreamin' of a world
Where all that's good so we were told
We need a hero
And we keep dreamin' of a time
Where good is all that we can find
We need a
We need a
Hero
No, We cannot tell
Who's the one to lead us
But you know that we'll be there
Waiting for them to find us
And we keep dreamin' of a world
Where all that's good so we were told
We need a hero
And we keep dreamin' of a time
Where good is all that we can find
We need a
We need a
Hero
Instrumental
And we keep dreamin' of the world
Where all that's good so we were told
We need a hero
And we keep dreamin' of a time
Where good is all that we can find
We need a hero
And we keep dreamin' of a world
Where all that's good so we were told
We need a hero
And we keep dreamin' of a time
Where good is all that we can find
We need a
We need a
Hero
