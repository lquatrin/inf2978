Feet High Up in the Air Get Your Feet High Up in the Air
Feet High Up in the Air Get Your Feet High Up in the Air
Freestyle
My Mind Is Reelin' I Got a Funny Feelin'
Sayin' This Ain't the Place to Be
I'm Workin' Nine to Five I Got Stay Alive
Singin' no Easy Way to Be Free
I Want to Take a Stand Want a Brand New Plan
Got a Heart Felt Sympathy
I Bust Out of My Cage I'm in An Animal Rage
Cut Me Loose Don't Mess With Me
Chorus
Feet High Up in the Air Get Your Feet High Up in the Air
Steppin' in Time to the Rhythm of the Rhyme
You Go For Yours I'll Go For Mine
Lookin' For a Reason Out of Reasoning Season
And I'm Lookin' For a Piece of Mind
The Clean Cut Chimps Party Hearty Pimps
Want to Show Me How to Waste My Time
I've Got a Groove to Move a Groovy Point to Prove
Give a Listen to My Rhythm and Rhyme
Where There's a Will and a Way I Hear It Everyday
It's a Beat of a Different Kind
Chorus
Cut Loose the Blues Make It Wild and Loose
You Can Do Anything You Choose
Can't Hold Me Back I'm Fully Strapped
Light Years Out Ahead of the Pack
No Same Old Thing I'm a Loaded Spring
I Got the Power I Can Do Anythng
So Plain to See Freestylin' Is For Me
Chorus
