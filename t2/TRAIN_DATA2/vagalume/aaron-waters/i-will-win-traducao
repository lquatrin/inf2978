I know the deal
I know their sound
I know their feel
Well I know the end
And all I say is all I ever have to say
I know the sign
So I am right and I am real
I know exactly how it feels
I will win
I wont stop until I get them
I will win
I know the thrill
I know their feel
I know the call
Well I know the time
And all I have to do is all I ever do
Well I know the game
'Cause I am right and I am real
I know exactly how it feels
Cause I
will win
I wont stop until I get them
I will win
Solo
'Cause I am right and I am real
I know exactly how it feels
Cause I
will win
I wont stop until I get them
I will win
I will win
I wont stop until I get them
I will win
