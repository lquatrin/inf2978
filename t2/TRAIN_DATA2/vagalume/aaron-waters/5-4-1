You'll come calling, slowly crawling
Attitude defined
Take and conquer, is your honor
Weak of soul and mind
Call on the five
Keep hope alive
Call the 5-4-1
Anytime you say you want us
Call the 5-4-1
Everytime you say you need us
Call the 5-4-1
Anytime you say you want us
Call the 5-4-1
Everytime you say you need us
5-4-1
5-4-1
5-4-1
5-4-1
Go!
Instrumental
Call the 5-4-1
Anytime you say you want us
Call the 5-4-1
Everytime you say you need us
Call the 5-4-1
Anytime you say you want us
Call the 5-4-1
Everytime you say you need us
