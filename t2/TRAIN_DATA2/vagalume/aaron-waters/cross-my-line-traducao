I will hunt you down in time, will have you in my sight
Can see throughout this night, will find your weakness
Now, you belong to me solely
Now, I will shatter your chances
Now, say the power is on you now
You have a reason, you have a rhyme
You have been thinking to cross my line
You were the soul mate, you were the crime
You've gone too far, you've crossed my line
I am one who never quits, am one who tries to rise
Am pure of thought and mind, am sure of one thing
Now, that I stare in your bad face
Now, I see you're a weakling
Now, say the power is on you now
You have a reason, you have a rhyme
But you had chosen to cross my line
You were the soul mate, you were the crime
You've gone too far, you've crossed my line
You've gone too far
You've gone too far
You have a reason, you have a rhyme
But you were way wrong to cross my line
You were the soul mate, you were the crime
You've gone too far, you've crossed my line
