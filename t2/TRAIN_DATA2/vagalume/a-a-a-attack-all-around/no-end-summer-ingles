The tempting sun, a holiday tune 
Filled to bursting, body and mind 
The harsh sunshine teases 
A love call in an oasis 
Oh yeah! 
Time is jealous 
Embraced by the wind 
Feel it with your heartbeat 
Oh yeah! 
The hottest summer 
No end summer 
Forever... 
Just like this with you I'm sure 
Burning a rustling premonition 
No end summer 
Remember... 
The instant I become familiar with your skin 
So hot it takes my words away 
Hold on! Hold on! 
My head's so full of summertime 
So hot and hot, the heat of Shangri-la, no end 
No lie, lovin' you life 
It will never end 
If you need proof, put your hand on my back 
The scratches you and the summer left behind 
Oh yeah! 
Whenever you turn around, the beads of water on your chest 
Secretly shake 
Oh yeah! 
Melting in the backlight 
No end summer 
Forever... 
Just like this with you some more 
I want to burn this rising emotion into my memory 
No end summer 
Remember... 
Discard th heartless behavior 
And give me the smile of eternal summer
