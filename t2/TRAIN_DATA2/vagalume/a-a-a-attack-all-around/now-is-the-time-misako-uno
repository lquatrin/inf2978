On the night you found me
I know that you changed my world
Happened in a second
All that I have waited for
I didn't know you
But you were not a stranger to me
More than familiar
In you I can see me
Now you're here with me
It's plain to see
There is no more reason to wait patiently
In this moment, won't you come and hold me?
Just bring me to you
Now is the time
Everytime that I see you
It's like I can breathe again
All my fears and worries disappear in your tender smile
Even just thinking of you
It's all I need to feel so good
Hear your voice deeply and it just soothes me
I can't imagine there's a deeper love
All that's left is that I feel your touch
In this moment, won't you come and hold me?
Just bring me to you
Now is the time
I wanna be yours
Now is the time
