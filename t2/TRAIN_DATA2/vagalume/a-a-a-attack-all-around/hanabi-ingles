I badgered a goldfish swimming like flower petals 
So I could treasure our summer days 
Once again this breezy season has come 
And I stumble over memories on the night road 
I always chased after your broad back 
Knowing somewhere 
That an end would come to these perfect days 
The flickering fireworks 
I close my eyes and my heart races 
I can see your profile in my mind's eye 
I'm eagerly waiting for the summer dawn 
The sound of rain at dawn, the amber loneliness 
Is it sunny where you live? 
I don't have the courage to look back 
On all your kindness and the scenery of the past 
Left behind with sunburnt memories 
The gently setting sun surrounded everything 
Your smile, the days we played together 
Will it all one day disappear? 
Seeing off the remnants of evening 
As the windchimes echo in the moonlight tonight 
The flickering fireworks 
I close my eyes and my heart races 
I can see your profile in my mind's eye 
I'm eagerly waiting far away 
The distant water shimmers 
I raised my hands as if in prayer 
Leaning back in the night, I looked up quietly 
And saw a small firefly fluttering in the sky
