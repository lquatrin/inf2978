You used to say, everyday
We will always be this way
Flying Angels lifting high
To reach the sun where I belong
Girl you know you are the one
Above the clouds I see you cry
You know that when you smile
You stop the rain (stop the rain)
And we will be together
Once again
Although I’m gone remember me
Please be strong
I’ll never leave
And just hold on
To the memories
Cause while I’m here
All I’m thinking about is
Tomorrow
I’ve always known
The love you’ve shown
Means you’ll never be alone
There’ll be times you wonder why oohh…
Seeing you with someone new
Used to make me feel so blue
But now I’m with you
All the time
Oooh...'Cause you know that when you smile
You stop the rain
And we will be together once again
Although I’m gone remember me
Please be strong
I’ll never leave
And just hold on
To the memories
Cause while I’m here
All I’m thinking about is
Tomorrow
From the moment that I looked into your eyes
All of my life I thought I’d be here
By your side, I wish I’d took the time to find
The words to say (to say)
You know that when you smile
You stop the rain
And we will be together once again
Although I’m gone remember me
Please be strong
I’ll never leave
Just hold on
To the memories
Cause while I’m here
All I’m thinking about is
Tomorrow
Cause while I’m here
All I’m thinking about is
Tomorrow
