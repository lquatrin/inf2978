There was nothing to say the day she left
Just filled a suitcase full of regrets
I hailed a taxi in the rain
Looking for some place to ease the pain, ooh
Then like an answered prayer
I turned around and found you there
[Chorus]
You really know where to start
Fixing a broken heart
You really know what to do
Your emotional tools can cure any fool
Whose dreams have fallen apart
Fixing a broken heart
Now I don't understand what I'm going through
There must be a plan that led me to you
Because the hurt just disappears
In every moment that you are near, yeah
Just like an answered prayer
You made the loneliness easy to bear
[Repeat Chorus]
Soon the rain will stop falling baby
Let's forget the past
Cause here we are at last
[Repeat Chorus]
