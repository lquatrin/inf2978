I
can still remeber the time
you were there when I needed to hold you, feel you
everytime I ask you to find a new way
you lie a new way
is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
youll change
youll never change
youre never, never gonna keep you promises (2x) 
you said youd changed
but Im afraid
its something
I wont live to see
its seems so strange
that sometimes fate
can appear to be so real
and yet turn out to be fantasy 
chorus (part I):
same old line, one more time
say youre gonna be, ther for me
say youll change, change your ways
never gonna keep your promises
You know it
dosn't turn me on singing that same old song you don't want to
find me gone, gone, gone
same old game
brand new day
no more lies 
chorus(part II):
another night, another day 
what can I say
youre still the same old brand new you
you break your promises in two
what can I do
when youre the same old brand new you
youll change, youll never change
youre never, never gonna keep your promises (2x) 
because of you
I guess were through
is this the way it has to be
Ive been a fool
a fool for you
but Ive got better things to do than let you walk all over me 
chorus (part I) 
chorus (part II) 
I can still remeber the time
you were there when
I needed to hold you, feel you
everytime I ask you to find a new way
you lie a new way
is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
youll change, youll never change
youre never never gonna keep your promises (2x) 
chorus (part I) 
chorus (part II) 
another night, anoth
