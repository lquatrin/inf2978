I've walked the jungle,
fought a lion with bare hands
The Prince of Darkness,
I'm a far better man!
I've crossed the desert,
Never feared for my own
Where lightning strikes - I'll always go!
Eye of the tiger, not afraid to attack
Left Frankenstein - flat on his back
That witches' magic, just ain't nothing to see
Cos' you're the one, who cast a spell onto me!!
Break
If you're looking for danger, here I come!
You better look out, it's just begun!
Ther's something that I want you to know!
(AAAAGGHH!)
Chorus
The one thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you!
I get the shivers down my spine,
Feel my body turning blue!! (so blue!!)
The feeling is so frightening
It's driving me insane
The one thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you!
The Terminator - said he'd never be back!
Fight fire with fire, that's a natural fact
Tell me your nightmare, and I'll give you my dream
I will protect you - whenever you SCREAM!!
Because you're always there
To let me know - sometimes we all get scared
I'm telling you I cant let you go - oh!
Chorus - ad libs
I can feel it in the air, and my fever's going down
There's a chill across the town uh-oh-ooh-hoh!
The one thing that I'm scared of is
Losing hold of you!!
