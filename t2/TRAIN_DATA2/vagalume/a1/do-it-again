Chris: You just found heaven
It's safe to say
You do it again
Chris: It's been a while since you needed a shoulder to cry on
Now you're coming to me for a helping hand
Chris: You're out all night, fooling around

You do it again
Chris: You just can't get it right
But I'll be here for you my friend

You do it again
Chris: How can you turn your back on a girl you rely on?

Chris: You just can't get it right (Oh no, you can't)

Just like before
You do it again

It's the same old story time after time

You just found heaven
And threw it away
It's safe to say
You do it again
Chris: You just can't get it right (No, no, no, no)
But I
