I said I'd never leave you
I said that I would never let you down
I needed a chance to prove my love to you
Til' time is through
The promises I gave you
I never meant to see them left untrue
You were my everything, I give my
heart to you - to start anew
And all of the days just pass me by
So I pray, and I'm asking why
All that I ask is one more try
Cos I never wanna say goodbye
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I'd never be untrue
Cos all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
You're looking for another
I'm looking for a chance with you again
I guess I never showed you
What you mean to me
Can't you see
Everything I told you
And everything I did I feel was wrong
I didn't know the words I said would
Make you leave, please believe
And all of the days just pass me by
So I pray, and I'm asking why
All that I ask is one more try
Cos I never wanna say goodbye
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I never be untrue
Cos all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only, if only, if only, all I do
If only, if only, if only, all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I'd never be untrue
Cos all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only I listened to my heart
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart
Now all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
If only we two could start anew
I promise I never be untrue
Cos all I can dream about is you
And baby that's all I do
