What have I become
I wish that I could go some place
Where nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you
This heart it weighs a ton
Some memories you can't escape
And nobody shows you how
Nobody shows you how
Yet I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
It happens everyday
I don't want friends around
Still I don't wanna be alone, no no
Somebody hold me now
Somebody hold me now
Cause I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
It happens everyday
Sometimes
A sinner becomes a saint
Sometimes
Believers can lose their faith
Sometimes
We learn from our mistakes
So I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
It happens everyday
It happens everyday
