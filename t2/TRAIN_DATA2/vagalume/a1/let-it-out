You said you need a groom this evening
I told you I'm leaving
Till you bagged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me
You promised to please me
Then you take it away
The fire's fading baby stook it up
And let it roll up your sleeves
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up
And that I need space to breath
If you can't wait any longer
Let it out
Let it in
If you think time will make you stronger
Let it out
Let it in
Let it out
You used to keep me up till the morning
Keeping me warm until I had to be gone
And now you can't find any room in your head
You see you got out of bed
Well that my coffee ain't on
The door is open do you locked it up
And then you threw out the key
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up
That I need space to breath
Let it out
Let it in
I can't wait (x2) 
Let it out
Let it in
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Till you let me in
I can't wait
