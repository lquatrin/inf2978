The sun went down so long ago
I watched you cry I had to go
Forever only lasted just a day
And now without you by my side
The visions of a lonely life
Take me to a dream in a place so far away
I see an angel and I think of you
I watch her hide behind a smile
And then I think of what I have to do
If only I had listened for a while
I still believe, I still believe
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
I still believe, I still believe
It's not the end, let's start again
I still believe
The emptiness of what could be
Shows everything you mean to me
It started out a game I'd never played
If I defy the foolish pride
And find that place so deep inside
Take me to my dream, I know I have to stay
I see a rainbow and I think of you
Of what we had, of what we were
And then I think of what I have to do
If only I had listened for a while
I still believe, I still believe
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
I still believe, I still believe
It's not the end let's start again
I still believe
Everybody's always asking me why
Why I did, what I did to make you cry
Please believe me when I say what I say
I didn't mean to go away
At the time I couldn't stay
(Instrumental break)
I see an angel and she sees me too
And as she wipes a teary eye
I know exactly what I have to do
To start a new beginning in my life
I still believe, I still believe
A love so strong will carry on
You know there's so much to be seen
I still believe, I still believe
It's not the end let's start again
I still believe
You know I still believe
It's not the end, let's start again
I still believe
