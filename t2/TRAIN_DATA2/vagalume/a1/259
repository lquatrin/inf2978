Sunday Football i got boot off the pitch
Some people gamble as a way to get rich
I got to find a better way to invest in zeroes
The say that rent may damage your wealth
I'd rather save it all to spend on myself
I got a letter of eviction and I'm no hero
Bridge
I'm not a saver i'm a spender
I'm a one weekender
Chorus
What can we do when our two worlds collide
there's only ten ways to survive all the chances of  knowing
After a hard day at work i go home
I don't know where i'm going but i'm ready to go
Said i made a lot of money but got nothing to show
And now it's 2:59
and i'm still waiting for the train to go home
I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of life
Plenty of butter but i don't have a knife
Sure beats the hell out of waiting for a ticket to Rino
Watching Tv makes me really upset
I wonder why I haven't been on it yet
I'm still waiting for a part in a Tarantino
Bridge
Chorus
Yeah i said i wanna go home
What can we do when our two worlds collide
ahhhhhhhhh
After a hard day at work i go home
I don't know where I'm going but i'm ready to go
I said i made alot of money but got nothing to show
And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home
Yeah I'm waiting for the train to go home
