Could you love a boy
Like me tonight,
Come on baby won't you take a bite
Could you love a boy like me tonight
Oh yeah!
There's magic within you,
There's magic in everything you do,
Magic me to the place where
Dreams come true.
Sometimes I co crazy
I get off the crazy things you do,
I'm jealous of every guy that
Looks at you
So tell me,
Could you love a boy like me like me
Tell me could you love a boy like me like me.
Because I need you
You're my heart and soul.
And I'm gonna let you know
Ain't gonna let you go.

Cos I'll keep searching
I'll keep seaching for love.
