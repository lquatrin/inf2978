I'm tired of fighting,
Got a fever when you try to get out
I've tried but I can't understand what all the fuss is about
I wish that I could be the man that you wanted me to be
I need you to see...
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly (you know I try)
My souls full of pain when you cry (when you cry, baby when you cry)
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
But everything I do just tears your heart in two
I wonder why
I never thought that being lovers meant that we can't be friends
If only I could understand what makes you feel it's the end
What can I say to make you stay and stop breaking free from me?
I need you to see (that I)
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly (you know I try)
My souls full of pain when you cry (when you cry, baby when you cry)
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
But everything I do (everything I do)
Just tears your heart in two
I wonder why
Can't you see it's killing me?
It's not the way things used to be
Can you remember yesterdays
(yesterday we used to smile)
We used to smile without a care
Whenever you and I were near
Can't you see that I want to be with you?
Everything I do tears your heart in two
(I try)
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly (you know I try)
My souls full of pain when you cry (when you cry, baby when you cry)
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try
But everything I do just tears your heart in two
I wonder why
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly (you know I try)
(I can't seem to fly)
My souls full of pain when you cry (when you cry, baby when you cry)
I wish I was perfect and God knows I try (God knows, God knows I try)
But everything I do just tears your heart in two
I wonder why
I try and I try yet I can't seem to fly (you know I try)
My souls full of pain when you cry (when you cry, baby when you cry)
I wish I was perfect...
