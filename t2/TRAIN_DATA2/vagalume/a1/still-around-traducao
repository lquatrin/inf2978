In this life of uncertainty
There are people that we all need
Someone to face you, with no disguise
In you there's a remedy
That makes everyday seem trouble free
No distance and no device
'Cos you hear the words
When no one understands
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
You're still around
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
'Cos you're still, you're still around
Now I've stumbled on uncertainty
Never thought this could ever be
No contradictions left inside
When I feel the rain come my way
You give me sun, you're my brighter day
Intuition's telling me to stay
'Cos you hold the words
When nothing's left to say
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
You're still around
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
'Cos you're still, you're still around
In this life of uncertainty
There are people that we all need
Someone to face you, with no disguise
In you there's a remedy
That makes everyday seem trouble free
No distance and no device
'Cos you hear the words
When no one understands
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
You're still around
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
'Cos you're still, you're still
When my world has come undone
And I've lost my setting sun
When all I see are clouds
You're still around
When I fall into a tear
Inspirations disappear
You clear away that doubt
'Cos you're still, you're still around
