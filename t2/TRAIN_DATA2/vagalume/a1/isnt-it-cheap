This punky club was spinning fores off a funky tee
I'm on the floor and she was watching me
Guess she was fine with a head to thigh inspection
With my back against the wall I played it casually
Man, I don't know but when she smiled at me
And started grinding her ass on a whole lot of dirt and chocolate
I had to say something
Camera shy, No style, getting away,
I said I wanna take you home to love,
And she said
Let me take you to a place you know
Right beside the dirty little big show
Love me and delight me but I'm not what you need
And nothing comes for free
Isn't it cheap
As soon as she got me alone there wasn't a hesitation
And started taking off all her clothes to Lady Paris singing
I was checkin' her out all night with a lethal addiction
The way she almost put up a fight was so close to affection
Tired  eyes, No ties, turn on the light
I want to see what gets you hot tonight
And she said
Let me take you to a place you know
Right beside the dirty little big show
Love me and delight me but I'm not what you need
And nothing comes for free
Isn't it cheap
come on,
i said come on,
ummm,
come on and bring it baby
isnt it cheap,
Isn't it cheap when I'm down on my knees
Talking sweet just to meet your demands
See your delight as your stealing my night
Just to play it straight into my hands
let me take ya,
let me take ya baby,
come on and give it to me,
Let me take you to a place you know
Right beside the dirty little big show
Love me and delight me but I'm not what you need
And nothing comes for free
