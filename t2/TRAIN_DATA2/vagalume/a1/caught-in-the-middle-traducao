You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
But for me you never really had the time
I was blind, No
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly
Things are so different now you're gone
Thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think 'bout is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Movin'on she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory, that I can't erase
It's here to stay
wohh ohh
Things are so different now you're gone
Thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think 'bout is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
(So different)
So different
(So easy)
Oh... so easy
(But I can't get over you)
I can't get over you
(So different)
So different
(So easy)
So easy
(But I can't get over you)
And can't get over you
No way
Things are so different now you're gone
Thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think 'bout is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
Thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think 'bout is you
(And now I'm caught)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Things are so different now you're gone
Thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think 'bout is you
And now I'm caught in the middle
