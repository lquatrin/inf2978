(Chorus)
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
All we need is a miracle baby
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
All we need is a miracle
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
All we need is a miracle baby
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
All we need is a miracle
(Verse 1)
Last night I thought you said that you want me
I guess it was a crazy dream
Just think, we could be good together
I know that we were meant to be
Hey, I see your looking out for another
Save a little love for me
I'll be here waiting
Till the day you see
(Bridge)
All I want it you to open the door
Don't fight the feeling
Don't leave me alone no more
(Repeat chorus)
(Verse 2)
Don't think that I will ever take for granted
The lovin' that you give to me
See you, will never be in need of another
As long as you'll be here with me
Hey. I won't be around forever
So come and take a chance with me
I promise you girl this is meant to be
(Repeat Bridge)
(Repeat Chorus)
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Just a miracle
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Just a miracle
Just a miracle
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Just a miracle
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Just a miracle
Just a miracle
(Repeat Bridge)
(Chorus X2)
