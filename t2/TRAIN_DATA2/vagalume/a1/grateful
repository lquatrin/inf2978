When I'm grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Like a ship against the tide
Still I know, there's a simple truth
I am grateful
When I hear the saddest song
In that moment
I know I am not alone
Someone else, feels the same way too
To be grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
Ever grateful
For the scars along the way
And I'm thankful
For each mistake I've made
Cause somehow, it all led me to you
To be grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
When I'm grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Still so good to be alive
Cause I know, I shared it all with you
