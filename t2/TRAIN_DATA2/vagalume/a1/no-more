You say you're gonna work it out, then you say you're having doubts.
Tellin me you'll walk away, but then you go and stay
Calling me day and night, saying he don't treat you right.
Then you always turn around and give him one more try.
Baby you know it isn't fair, you expect me to be there.
But we never get no-where.
[Chorus:]
I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more.
l'll make a long story short, time too make up your mind girl.
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more.
If I'm not what you want, I don't wanna hear no more.
Stop telling me you need more time, tired of the same old line.
Better make a move or you are gonna find, are you taking it.
Cos you know it's wrong, better let him know it's time too go your moving on.
Baby you don't know how close I am to being gone.
waited on you long enough,
I can only take so much, tell me if I have your heart.
(How do you really love)
Baby you know it isn't fair, you send me to be there.
But we never get no-where.
[Chorus]
(I don't wanna hear no more)
If your sure that you really love me.
(I don't wanna hear no more)
Out the door if you still don't know.
I've be there for you and you know it's true,
you belong with me. What you gonna do (I don't wanna hear no more)
[Chorus Till End]
