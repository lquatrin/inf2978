You and me
We sit and talk of friendship then I ask
If you can see
If we could be together, forever
I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you're scared you'll hurt
So you don't want to try
Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you'll see
Then you'll never regret the things we never did
You turn to me, I see your eyes, and somehow they cease to shine
You smile at me yet I can see, you don't think we can make it
You see the ligth die in my eyes, coz I'm scared to lose you
I wish you would try
Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you'll see
Then you'll never regret the things we never did
I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you're scared you'll hurt
So you don't want to try
Well take a chance and come home with me
You could stay for eternity
If you try then at least you'll see
Then you'll never regret the things we never did
Then you'll never regret the things we never did
Regret the things we never did
