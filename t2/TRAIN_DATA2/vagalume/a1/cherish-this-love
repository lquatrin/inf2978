Ben: Sorry for making you cry, 
For turning away as you walk on by, 
But baby I need to be strong and 
I need to move on with my life, 
You know it's not that I don't care, 
So don't make me feel bad, it's not fair. 
Cos baby you know all the reasons, 
I made my decision in life. 
Ben: Now a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, 
And a boy has to become a man, 
And I'm sorry for saying but it's love that I need, 
And that love I just can't get from you. 
Ben: It's funny how things turn around, 
One day I am lost, then I'm found, 
It happened so fast, 
I knew it would last, 
From the first time I first looked in her eyes, 
Although it's so soon this I know, I'll never be on my own, 
As dreams turn to tears, 
She buries my fears and I will 
Cherish this love ever more, 
Ben: You know it's not easy to do, 
Turning my back, on me and you, 
But baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life (Someone who cares for my life). 
Smiles they turned into tears, 
And all of my dreams, they all disappeared, 
Baby this cannot be right so I'll turn down the light 
On our love, 
Ben: Now a boy's gotta do, 
What a boy's gotta do, 
And a girl has to do what she can, 
And I'm sorry for saying but it's love that I need, 
And that love I just can't get from you 
Ben: It's funny how things turn around,

Cherish this love e
