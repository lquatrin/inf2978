Chris: The crazy things I heard you say
I'm mad about you all the same
I never really saw the crime
Yet went ahead and served my time
I've never met someone like you before
But sometimes that is not enough
Coz I can't help this feeling
Chris: I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you
Chris: I will regret this choice of mine
I never want to see you cry
I care about you endlessly
You deserve a deeper love than me
I don't know if I'll make it on my own
But I've tried so hard to let it go
And I can't hide this feeling
Chris: I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy (Crazy) , crazy (Crazy)
Crazy (Crazy) for leaving you
Chris: And I know that I will miss you like a fool
But there's something missing in my life
And I can't hide this feeling
Chris: I must be crazy for leaving you
Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy
Crazy for leaving you
