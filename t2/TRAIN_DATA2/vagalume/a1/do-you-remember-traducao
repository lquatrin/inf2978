Ben: Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful - We had it all
No use looking to the past
We both knew it wouldn't last
But it was fun, we had a blast
So beautiful. As I recall
Where did it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Paul: Say do you remember the 1st of December
When we were riding on the back seat
Turn the radio on and play our favourite song
And then we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing?
All: Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Mark: Breaking rules we always would
Doing the things we never should
We were so bad but it felt so good
Do you remember say do you remember
I wonder where you are tonight
But I know that you'll be alright
Cos I see our star is shining bright
It's so beautiful it will never fall
Where did you go
Come on now, say that
Paul: Say do you remember the 1st of December
When we were riding on the back seat
Turn the radio on and play our favourite song
And then we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad
But they don't have to know, yeah
Do you remember singing?
All: Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
All: Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
