Could be your eyes
Could be your smile
Could be the way you freed my mind
You precious touch caressed my soul
You gave me everything I need
And now I'm lost
Lost forever
Lost forever
And you said this is going nowhere, girl
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you
Could be the lies
Could be my pride
Could be the days and nights so wild
Could be the times I wasn't there
And all the nights we didn't share
And now you're lost
Lost forever
Lost forever
And you said this is going nowhere,girl
And you said I turned my back on
You said I'm not the only one for you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you
I can't sleep, I can't live without you by my side
So cold
So lost without you as my guide
You made me realise I'm nothing
Nothing without you
Please give it one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you
Baby give me one more try
