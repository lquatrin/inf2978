Ben: Let me tell you ‘bout this a girl
that once was mine
Once upon a time she’s nothing bout trouble
Up till now I was a man of common senses
Funny how I just give up on my defences
But she’s one of a kind
Just a girl that can easily twist your mind
But right now it feels so fine
All: She’s noting but trouble
Trouble’s her name
She’s drivin’ me crazy
It’s kind of insane
I’m searching for reason
To letting her go
Cause somewhere inside of me
I know
She’s nothing but trouble
Ben: Nothing but trouble
Mark: Everyone says I’m playing
A game with fire
It’s too late I’m just caught
Up in my desire
Oohh…yeah..
Cause she’s one of a kind
Just a girl that can easily twist your mind oohh..
But right now it feels so fine
All: She’s noting but trouble
Trouble’s her name
She’s drivin’ me crazy
It’s kind of insane
I’m searching for reason
To letting her go
Cause somewhere inside of me
I know
She’s nothing but trouble
Ben: Nothing but trouble
Chris: When I look in her eyes (In her eyes)
It’s just so hard to take anyone’s advice (oooo…)
But somewhere I realise
All: She’s noting but trouble (yeah)
Trouble’s her name
She’s drivin’ me crazy
It’s kind of insane
I’m searching for reason
To letting her go
Cause somewhere inside of me
I know
She’s nothing but trouble
All: She’s noting but trouble she’s nothing
Trouble’s her name (paul-trouble’s her name)
She’s drivin’ me crazy (paul-driving me crazy)
It’s kind of insane (paul-kind of insane)
I’m searching for reason (paul-I’m searching for reason)
To letting her go (paul-letting her go)
Cause somewhere inside of me

She’s nothing but trouble
