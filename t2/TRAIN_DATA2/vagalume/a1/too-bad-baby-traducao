can this be?
is there something wrong with you and me?
guess we'll see
i confess
i don't know know how we got into this mess
might have guessed
day by day
youre slowl running out of things to say
so i may
ask you why is it always me who has to try?
to make things feel right
pre chorus
you never told me what you feel inside
i thought you loved me now i realise
no matter how i try
you never seem to be satisfied
now your telling me its
chorus x2
too bad baby that your so good to me
i like you you loved me
too bad baby your so into me
i cant breathe
you fall in love to easily
me and you
are slowly running out of things to do
nothing new i dont know
why we dont agree
when i say yes you say no
dont be shy
please tell me why it is that we dont see
eye to eye
so confused im feeling helpless and im feeling used
like yesterdays news girl
repeat pre chorus and chorus
break
it started from the day i met her
walked over me i let her
friends who told me go and get her
theyre telling me forget her
too bad baby think im going crazy
someone take me nothings gonna save me
repeat chorus
