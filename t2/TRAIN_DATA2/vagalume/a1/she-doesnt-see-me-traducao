When she passes me by, she's a ray of light
Like the first drop of sun from the sky
And I know she's a Queen, who deserves a king
But i'm not a King
And she doesn't see me
When she dances she moves me to a smile
I see everything near her shine
There is a grace in her ways I can't contain
I don't have that grace
So she doesn't see me
And the closer I get I can't help but hide
So ashamed of my body and voice
There are boundaries we pass in spite of the war
But our own, we can't seem to cross
He has a way that surrounds him, so delicate
With a glory that reigns in his life
He is also so much that he is not
But these things they don't see
And she doesn't see me
There are things we can change if we just choose to fight
But the walls of injustice are high
When she passes me by, she's a ray of light
Like the first drop of sun from the sky
And i know shes a queen who deserves a king
Someone other than me
Different from me
She doesn't see me
She doesn't see me
