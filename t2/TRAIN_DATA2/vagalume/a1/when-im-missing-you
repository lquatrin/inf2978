Ben: Sunday morning
Time to say goodbye
But I'll be home real soon
Through I'm leaving
Girl, don't start to cry
I'll be thinking of you
Yeah
Paul: It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
Ben: How can I sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with a tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June
That's how it feels
When I'm missing you
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, oh, oh
Mark: Now, time ain't healin'
Another week gone by
Girl, it feels like a year
I've been calling
Every day and night
How I wish you were here
Oh yeah
Paul And Chris): It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm counting down the days till I'm home again
Ben: How can I sing when my words have run dry (How can I sing?)
How can I smile with a tear in my eye (Tear in my eye)
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June
That's how it feels (That's how it feels)
When I'm missing you
Chris: I never met a girl who was so damn sweet
Can't wait to see you again, oh...
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreaming till then
Ooh, my baby
Instrumental Break
Ben: I said tell me now baby
How can I sing when my words have run dry (How can I sing?)
How can I smile with a tear in my eye (Tear in my eye)
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June
That's how it feels (That's how it feels)
When I'm missing you
Ben: Oh yeah, baby (How can I smile?)
I say, so missing you (Ooh...)
Summer's so lost when it's raining in June
That's how it feels (That's how it feels)
