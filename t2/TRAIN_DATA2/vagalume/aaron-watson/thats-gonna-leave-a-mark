First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
In the parking lot of that old 7 11
I filled up a truck
I went in to pay when I walked out
she was with him smilin' as she drove away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark
If you play with fire you're bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would've learned
but she's lookin so hot, so what can I say
My mama said don't but I did it anywayy
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark
Awwh tug on them hard strings now
I wish you didn't look so dang good
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way if there's any
It's a lot shinnin' brighter than the sun
like a sock from above tellin' me to run awayy
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark
