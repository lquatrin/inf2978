I'm there to greet you when your life begins.
You'll start your journey on your knees and hands.
I offer many choices and places you can go;
but you must choose,
cause i'm just the road.
I'm paved with memories, glory and regrets.
I'm lined with broken dreams and cigarettes.
You can take all you can hold,
but if you stumble beneath your load;
don't blame me, I'm just the road.
I'm a million miles before you,
I'm a million miles behind,
I'll take you strait and narrow,
I'll ramble and I'll wind.
So curse my broken brim-stone,
or kiss my bricks of gold.
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road.
The road to riches,
a path of righteousness.
Through busy cities or through a mountain mess.
I'll take you on the highway or sneak you through the low.
But it's your call, I'm just the road.
I'm a million miles before you,
I'm a million miles behind,
I'll take you strait and narrow,
I'll ramble and I'll wind.
So curse my broken brim-stone,
or kiss my bricks of gold.
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road.
Your last breath is not the death of me,
I'll take you on to where your ticket reads.
To that place where I hope shining angels great your soul,
but if they don't, I'm just the road.
I'm a million miles before you,
I'm a million miles behind,
I'll take you strait and narrow,
I'll ramble and I'll wind.
So curse my broken brim-stone,
or kiss my bricks of gold.
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road.
I'm a million miles before you,
I'm a million miles behind,
I'll take you strait and narrow,
I'll ramble and I'll wind.
So curse my broken brim-stone,
or kiss my bricks of gold.
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road.
So don't you thank me, don't you blame me,
when you're in that judgement throne;
Cause I'm not the reason, I'm just the road.
