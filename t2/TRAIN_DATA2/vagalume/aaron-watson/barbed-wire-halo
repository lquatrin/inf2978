Well God bless Texas
And Deacon Shackelford
He read the Bible seven times
And he believed every word
That old beat up leather book
Had been through it all
He sat on the back pew
So he could chew him a chaw
Singin' amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
He carried candy for the kids
In his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishin' after church
And taught me things I needed to know
No, deacon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation
That I was his grandkid
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down a street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand-spankin' new wings
And his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace
Before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tattoo
He was on a ship off at sea
When she died in child birth
He lost his whole world
From the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah, life took him to hell band back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil
Til he was black and blue
Singin' I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down a street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand-spankin' new wings
And his barbed wire halo
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't
You know I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down a street paved with gold
Yeah sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country and soul
He's showin' off his brand-spankin' new wings
And his barbed wire halo
Sweet chariot comin' forth to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot comin' forth to carry me home
