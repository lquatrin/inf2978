Born and raised in Oklahoma
The Young man moved to Tennessee
He started running with the devil
Chasing that honky tonker’s dream
While at some dive outside of L. A
On life’s highway headed southbound
She was sent from up above
And her true love turned his world around
Chorus
God bless angels and pray for outlaws
To find a new found love for their lost cause
Lord knows she loved him despite all his flaws
And he loved her cause she made him wanna be a better man
No there weren’t no halo
Above her beautiful brown hair
And though he never saw her wings
He always knew they were there
Cause she had this way of knowing
When he needed her the most
It's like she had some kind of connection
With the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
Chorus
Lord knows it wasn't a cold day in hell
Like everybody thought it would be
Lord it was actually a beautiful July morning
When he and that preacher man came walking up out of that creek
Chorus
