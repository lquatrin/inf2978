Words cannot express the way you look in that white dress
I don't believe there's ever been such a beautiful sight
All my dreams are coming true that yellow rose ain't got nothing on you
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
Tears will be falling everywhere as you're letting down your hair
From cowboys wishing that it was them holding you tight
But that's the harsh reality and I'd feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
The Lonestar is shining bright above and there's magic in the air
And looking deep into your eyes I can't help but sympathize
With those who will never know the kind of love we share
Tears will be falling everywhere as you're letting down your hair
From cowboys wishing that it was them holding you tight
But that's the harsh reality and I'd feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
Yes hearts are breaking across Texas
