He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Someone who knows the blessin' of a good hard rain
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless his name
That's why God loves cowboys
I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tenden, the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
to those broken harded honky tonk angles
OOh
That's why God loves cowboys
He knew they need room and freedom
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies
He was there when he heard those prayers coming from shying
Right beside that young man on his last ride
That's why God loves cowboys
I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tenden
and the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
to those broken harded honky tonk angles
OOh
That's why God loved cowboys
Ooh those cold nights get lonely
He needs more then just a good fire keeping him warm
Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than a love of a woman weather life storm
That's why God loves cowgirls
I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs
tenden and the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride
to those broken harded honky tonk heros
OOh
That's why God loves cowgirls
OOh
That's why God loves cowboys
End
