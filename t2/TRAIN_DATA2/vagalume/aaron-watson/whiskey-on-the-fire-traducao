And he'll start drinking
Then he'll start thinking about her again
Again and again
He must've bribed the jukebox
Cause those ol' sad songs just won't end
They just won't end
His ol' broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame by pouring whiskey on the fire
Chorus
And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
Then he'll take another shot of a hundred proof misery
His old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame pouring whiskey on the fire
His tears fall like rain but his pain just won't die down
Cause there's another blaze that's brewing as he buys another round
Chorus
And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
Then he'll take a double shot of a hundred proof misery
His old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you can't put out an old flame by pouring whiskey
No you can't put out an old flame by pouring whiskey
He'll start drinking then he'll start thinking about her again
