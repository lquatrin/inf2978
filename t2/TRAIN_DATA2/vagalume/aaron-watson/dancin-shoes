By that look on your face
i know you know whats on my mind
Honey it's really half your fault
standing there looking that fine
I swear i can't believe my eyes
you look so good it almost hurts
Wearing nothing but a smile
and one of my old favorite sweatshirts
Chorus:
If you're wanting a reaction
girl I'm fixing to ignite
You say it takes two to tango
so put on your dancin' shoes tonight
There's still that magic when we touch,
just like i felt the very first time
And i have to pinch myself cause
i still can't believe you're mine
Lord knows i'm blessed to be the man
who gets to sweep you off your feet
When it comes to loving you,
you know i never miss a beat
Chorus
There's a full moon shining and
baby we're both fixing to find
What you get when you mix
soft kisses with a little red wine
Chorus
