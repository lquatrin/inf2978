(solo guitar)
i still think about us
in the rush that we felt
with the rag top down and the radio blasting
you were riding shot gun
in nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
looking better than the law should have been allowing
(chorus)
we hit the corners going 90
love had blindly fallen
head over heels over you
every feeling that we felt
was a feeling that felt brand new
and you looked just like an angel
with that cross on your necklace
you were young, i was wild, we were reckless
we'd drive on down to the river
burnin up those hot summer nights
laughing at the cowboys getting crazy
picking fights
it wasn't funny
when that deputy, caught you and me
steaming up those windows
and how your daddy never found out about it
honey, heaven only knows
Chorus
Young, wild, and recklace
