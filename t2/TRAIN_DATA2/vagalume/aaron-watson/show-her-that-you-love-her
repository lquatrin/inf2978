Sometimes she will laugh
Sometimes she will cry
Sometimes she'll be mad at you
And leave you wondering why
A woman's mind is a mistery
That no man can uncover
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her you that love her
What she wants, what she needs
May be too different things
And the words you hear so clear
Aren't always what they mean
She may say that she's cold at night
Just to have you hold her
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her that you love her
The ocean doensn't ask why
The moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings
She feels inside
You had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her that you love her
If she smiles and say that she loves you
As the tears roll from her eyes
Then you found a treasure
That only true love can find
A woman's heart has parts
That will never be discovered
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her that you love her
The ocean doensn't ask why
The moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings
She feels inside
You had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her that you love her
You had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time
Trying to figure her out
Show her that you love her
