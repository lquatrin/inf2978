Well my truck's wound up and it's ready to roll
D
I got a good buddy workin' for the Highway Patrol
So if I get a ticket or two, It's gonna be alright
But the sheriff and his boys they're in ???
D
Unless they're out to lunch at the Dairy Queen
They'll be itchin' to turn on those red, white, and blue
lights
Well just like my daddy I was born a drifter
I got a rebel heart and eight - ball shifter
Horns on the hood and forty channel CB
Well some things you never leave home without
Like your Bible, log book, and your drivin' route
And your Best Of Dale Watson on CD
Cause I'm a diesel drivin' daddy
Don't you get in my lane
Puttin' the pedal to the medal
Bringin' eighteen wheels of pain
I've been in love
Broke some hearts
Settled down long enough to replace the parts
Kicked a little ass
Fought along the way
There's a lonely life livin' on the road
When the only friend you've got is the radio
And even he fades in and out every now and then
But maybe someday you'll find the right one
(Everyone I'm sorry, but I can't understand a word he says on this line)
Knows how to get that big ole rig to spin
Chorus
I'm a panhandlin' manhandlin'
Post holin' high rollin' dust bowlin' daddy
I ain't got no blood in my veins
I just got them four lanes
Of hard Amarillo highway
Chorus
Up and down that honky tonkin' highway
They end the song by playing these chords pretty quick, so just use barre chords.
I apologize for some of the lyrics...I know they're off a little.
