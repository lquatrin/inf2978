Now there you go givin' that eye
with your hand on my thigh
you got me swervin' all over the place
You got me wantin' and needin'
you're the reason for my speedin'
and you know you can't blame it on the breaks
Blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin' you
Yeah when the sun goes down on the sleepy little town
you turn my world into a country love song
Take a good long look in the mirror
Naw, it couldn't be any clearer
and you'll see what turns my radio on
Blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin'
The way you love me
can't get enough of me
rain or shine, all the time, with all your heart and soul
I'll be lookin' in your eyes
by the time the sunrise comes
shinin' through your bedroom window
You can blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin' you
No, no matter what you do
girl you can't blame me for lovin' you
You can blame it on those baby blues
for lookin like you do
