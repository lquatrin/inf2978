He's wrinkled and gray
But he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage
Like a bird on a wire
Oh he'll pack 'em in
Just like he always did
Oh everybody loves the honky tonk kid
He got his first guitar
When he was 15
Thirstin' for knowledge
All hungry and green
Strummin' that six string
Just like Lefty did
Everybody loves the honky tonk kid
Chorus
Well the honky tonk kid loves the honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
But all the smoke and the neon keep his pain hid
Oh nobody knows the honky tonk kid
Ten million fans
And a handful of friends
But he'll go home alone
When each night ends
He'll think about her
And then twist off a lid
Nobody loves the honky tonk kid
Chorus
It won't be long
The Lord will take him away
He'll have sung his last song
They'll place a wreath on his grave
Oh and he'll draw a crowd
Just like he always did
Oh one last goodbye for the honky tonk kid
