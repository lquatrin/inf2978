When I left Tulsa she was still an innocent lady
Lord only knows why she ever loved a guy like you
She called me crying and she said she was having your baby
You turned your back on her and broke her heart in two
And I swore I'd get you For what you're putting her through
And the only reason I aint got you She begged me not to, says she loves you
Chorus:
But don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Now if that sun goes down on you
And if you're still here well you're going down too.
Don't let the sun go down on you in Tulsa
She's the only thing I've ever really cared for
No, She don't deserve this kind of shame
She carries a burden around that you know you're to blame for
You just laughed and said they ain't getting your name
Now your gonna pay
For what you're putting her through and the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to, says she loves you
But I ain't through with you yet
Chorus
