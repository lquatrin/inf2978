River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlight's out
Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
Don't get up just to get another you can drink from mine
We can't leave each other
We can dance with the dead, you can rest your head on my shoulder
If you wanna get older with me
Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't this a blessed kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
