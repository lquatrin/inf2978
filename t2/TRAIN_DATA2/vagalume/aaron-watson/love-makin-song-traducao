There's way to many lying, stealing, crying, cheating
Fool-hearted drinking songs about somebody who done somebody wrong
Honey honky tonkin' is what I do but my true love is loving you
So baby tonight we gonna write a love makin' song
Chorus
We can kick it off slow with a bottle of wine, or get straight to the ol' punch line
Either way it starts, it's gonna end with an all night long
It's guaranteed to be off the chart, solid gold, number one in my heart
Baby tonight we gonna write a love makin' song
Girl I get inspired by watching you
The sweet things you say and do
Maybe you got a few ideas of your own
Well, kiss for kiss and note for note
Shut the door and lock the deadbolt
Cause baby tonight we gonna write a love makin' song
Chorus X 2
Yea kiss for kiss and note for note, shut the door and lock the deadbolt
Cause baby tonight we gonna write a love makin' song
I said baby tonight we gonna write a love makin' song
A love makin' song
