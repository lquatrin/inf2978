Well, oh, don't you wanna hear a little 
Sawin' on the fiddle 
And the cryin' of a steel guitar 
Comin' from the heart and soul 
Born and bred in the ole Lonestar 
Forget those honkytonkin' blues 
Let me be your savin' grace 
If you wanna hear some country 
Then you've come to the right place 
You better stick around a while 
If you like Merle, Buck, & Johnny 
Then we might just get along 
But if you don't, go slap your mama 
Cuz your mama raised you wrong 
Well, oh, don't you wanna hear a little 
Sawin' on the fiddle 
And the cryin' of a steel guitar 
Comin' from the heart and soul 
Born and bred in the ole Lonestar 
Forget those honkytonkin' blues 
Let me be your savin' grace 
If you wanna hear some country 
Then you've come to the right place 
I like gravy on my biscuits 
I like my chicken fried 
I drink my coffee black 
And I sure like my Charley Pride 
Well I still salute Old Glory 
And I give glory to the Lord 
And I tip my hat to ole E.T. 
And his Texas Troubadours
