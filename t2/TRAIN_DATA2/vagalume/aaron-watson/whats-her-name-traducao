I swore id never love again a promise i’d keep till the end
But then you made a liar out of me
But even a man of his words can’t talk his way out of the hurt
When everything reminds him of his old used to be
Chorus
But you made me forget about
What’s her name i can’t remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time i try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
You made me forget about, what’s her name
Girl i was down and out without a shadow of a doubt
Until you shined your love light on me
I lost my faith in love my soul had given up
It took a miracle to make me believe
Chorus
But you made me forget about
What’s her name i can’t remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time i try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
You made me forget about
What’s her name i can’t remember a thing because my mind is always on you
I just draw a blank every time i try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two
You made me forget about, what’s her name
