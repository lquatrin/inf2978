They say he came out singing the moment he was born 
And he could pick that old flat top guitar like a farmer pickin' corn 
And he'd sneak in those old honky tonks until they'd kick him out 
And his daddy wonder how he learned all the stuff he sang about 
 
 
He sang songs about dogs 
Songs about drinking 
Songs about mama's and trains 
Songs about heart broke country boys 
Standin' out in the rain 
Songs about dancehall beauty queens 
Worth geting into a fight 
Songs about nothing better to do 
Songs about saturday night 
 
 
When he turned 18 he went off to the war 
His sweetheart wrote him letters she said she'd wait for sure 
By the time he came back home, she was nowhere to be found 
So he packed his bags hit them honky tonks from town to town 
 
He sang songs about dogs 
Songs about drinking 
Songs about mama's and trains 
Songs about heart broke country boys 
Standin' out in the rain 
Songs about dancehall beauty queens 
Worth geting into a fight 
Songs about nothing better to do 
Songs about saturday night 
 
Well everywhere he went, everybody knew his name 
But he never got the big hit, he stayed just the same 
And he moved back to the country when it was time to call it quits 
Now if you want to hear his music, you have to buy his greatest hits 
 
He sang songs about dogs 
Songs about drinking 
Songs about mama's and trains 
Songs about heart broke country boys 
Standin' out in the rain 
Songs about dancehall beauty queens 
Worth geting into a fight 
Songs about nothing better to do 
Songs about saturday night
