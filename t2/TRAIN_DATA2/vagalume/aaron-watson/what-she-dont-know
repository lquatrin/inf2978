Well she said she was not the one for me 
And there was nothing that I could do to change her mind 
She said she was sorry, but some things aren't meant to be 
She was unaware she was robbing her heart blind 
Oh, what she don't know is I'll always love her forever 
Oh, what she don't know is I would've never done her wrong 
Her under-estimation would break her heart for sure,
But she can't see 
What she don't know won't hurt her, but it's killing me 
Deep in the shadows of a smokey neon light 
I play myself in a lonely game of pool 
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side 
I take another shot, swallow my pride 
And I play a fool 
And watchin' her dance with him 
Around that empty hard-wood floor 
Is like rubbin' saw dust in the wound 
And I cry a little more
