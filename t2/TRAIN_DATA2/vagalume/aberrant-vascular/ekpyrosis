march over the fallen while the flames are closing in 
the last messiah and a faith so grim 
and no one will grow old 
The last red dawn lies upon the crowd 
and a shroud of decay lying on the ground 
i turn my head 
a sadness comes over me then 
something i could not feel before 
i knew it had to end 
but i had strenght to try some more 
all is gone 
the last messiah still goes on 
ever marching on 
the wheels are spinning 
it is so cold 
freezing below ground level 
hollow mindless slaves 
unborn 
metal whips are stinging 
flaying the skin 
skinning the soul 
and never will the sun 
ever be seen again 
i read somewhere 
sometime long ago 
in a book, i think it was called 
about socrates and the power of the self 
and of voltaire and his ways to escape 
lastly i heard the words of Nostradamus 
and how he foresaw that this would be the end 
when all is said 
and all is done 
no one cares about the dying sun 
there's no one left 
no cross to bear 
the dirt that's hidden everywhere 
the scent of the lotus has been lost 
for an eternity i searched in vain 
watched the leaves shiver and cease 
my immortality a faithful curse 
ironic that i should fall by my own hand 
the prophetised saviour 
the last messiah marches on
