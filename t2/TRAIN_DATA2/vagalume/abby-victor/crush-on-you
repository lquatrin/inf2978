Crush On You
Abby Victor
It's a Saturday, Saturday night
And I'm out, out with my friends
Partying, partying, then you walk in
I'm watching, I'm watching you boy
Don't know, don't know what to do to get you closer
This feeling I'm feeling, I can't hide it
I gotta keep this quiet
Leave this a secret
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel that I have a crush on you
I watch you secretly
You never glance at me
I try to shake it off
Should I forget about this?
I don't know what to do
What should I, how do I get me noticed?
Tell my friends, tell my friends, or dance it off?
So I, I got to keep this to myself
Nobody, nobody got to know
What can I say to you?
What can I do to let you know that I'm here?
I gotta keep this quiet
Leave this a secret
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel that I have a crush on you
I watch you secretly
You never glance at me
I try to shake it off
Should I forget about this?
Attention, class
Attention boys and girls
The way you talking around is driving me uh
I don't mind you making that noise
Clarence walk
I don't know why, I don't know why
The way you smile
The way you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, he-he-hey
You got it, got it, got it, got it, he-he-hey
You got it, got it, got it, got it, he-he-hey
You got it, got it, got it, got it, he-he-hey
Be free, I will not ever, won't leave you alone
Be free, are you talking, talking to me?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel that I have a crush on you
I watch you secretly
You never glance at me
I try to shake it off
Should I forget about this?
