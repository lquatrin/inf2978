I can feel the cold again
Press my nose against the windowpane
One leaf left upon the tree
I'm feelin low but then I hear you sing
You're my heart
You're my queen
You're my everything
You're the wind in my sail
Come and breathe your honesty into me
Lady love
I can be an enemy
To myself and give in easily
But when I do you're always there
To speak the truth and help me cast my cares
You're my heart
You're my queen
You're my everything
You're the wind in my sail
Come and breathe your honesty into me
You're my heart
You're my queen
You're my everything
You're the wind in my sail
Come and breathe your honesty into me
Lady love
