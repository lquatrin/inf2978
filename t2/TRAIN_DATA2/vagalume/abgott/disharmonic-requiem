The shadow fall
On the graves in the night sky.
A cold wind blow
and the moonlight freezes my soul.
My words are cold necromantical fog ride on the ground.
I locked in a spirit’s mirror
and in a ship of darkness I was burned.
Last sunset of the world is gone
From beyond I spread my wings
and shadow demon I’ve seen.
Demons gate over the mountain side
come forth on the wind
in the name of the ancient gods.
I’m waiting to consent my will
fire in the iced eyes
freeze.
Demons gate over the mountain side
come forth on the wind
in the name of the ancient gods
I’m waiting to… gates of hell.
I’m winter crystal eyes
cold like a stone
I shine in a new divine light…
darkness…
