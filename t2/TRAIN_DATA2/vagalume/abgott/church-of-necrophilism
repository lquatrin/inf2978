Unholy father i've seen
The impure unlight of the blind eye
the eternal gates
are opening
between mortal sights
A cold light and wind of undead
It comes, eternal
Darkness and universe
Cathartic daemon
Set on a divine
Reign of dead
Grimness hopeless
Inferior being can't
Kill what never was born
And yet creates
The kingdom hall built with
Evil demonic catharsis
Human flesh thy
Physical church
By the holy ghost
You won't be saved by thy
God plutonium
You won't be saved
