Mayhemic
From the dark past
which can eternal lie
their wrath tyrant.
Death may die
They watch upon the ancient temples.
Time so far
as mutilated steed
they ride the time
once again
in unknown dimension
inexorable pendulous sound the march.
We wait the time of their arrival
towards new aeons of
not order mayhemic.
They ride the violent way
the eternal stars are revolving
and I with them
in a perfect synchronism
natural is life energy.
alone questing the blinded voices
of an eternal divinity.
