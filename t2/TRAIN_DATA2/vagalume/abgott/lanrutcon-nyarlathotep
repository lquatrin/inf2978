Hail to you blind creature of the Abyss
Hail to you human Minister
Hail to you unknown creeping mayhem
You that have furrowed millennium time
To arrived undaunted to me
'and death comes through sky mind
like dark raven in the night.
Con il sangue accogliero' la tua grande Gloria
Our essences are bound from immortal death madness
Hail to you eternal Emperor of the light unlight
'and dead will rise from rotten earth to You
offering obscure woman's Hail
and wardrumms will play over
hymning thy unpronounceable name.
