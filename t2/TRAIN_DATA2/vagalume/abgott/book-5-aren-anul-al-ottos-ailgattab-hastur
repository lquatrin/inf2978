Nocturnal rustling
Demonic whispering
I see shape Shapeless wander foolish through me
Master of insanity knowing true
Of a Beast jaw in the useless human beings
Trumble, die superficial worms
You belive in thy useless, weak sense
No you won't live the Shapeless Insanity of Depth Being
It comes from the abyss
Shapeless noise I listen to time eternity balance
Now if shapeless my gaze mind leaving this world
To receive the right knowledge
Endless I am.
