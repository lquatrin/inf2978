Infecting the beauty
Distorting the image
A hollow vessel remains
My hands harvest destruction
While the heart longs for release
Memories resurrect
Exposing my filth
Cannot escape
How much of me holds value
Does the heart birth any flame
Feeling like a curse
Rooted within
As my humanity fades away
Grant me release
To conceal this infection
The infliction upon myself
To bring forth the change
My heart desires
Showing what I am worth
Will you give me the knife
To cut this part away
Soulless I have become
Entertaining demons of my own
The pinnacle of my faith
Residing in my maker's hands
Can I trust You unto completion
To finish the work within me
My hands harvest destruction
While the heart longs for release
Memories resurrect
Exposing my filth
Cannot escape
How much of me holds value
Does the heart birth any flame
Feeling like a curse
Rooted within
As my humanity fades away
Grant me release
To conceal this infection
