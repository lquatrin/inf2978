Strangulation, gasping within my hands
Choking from my grip
I see only death
Merciless retaliation
Brute force applied
The life that I have crushed
Within restoration
A failure before you
Forgiven in your sight
Unworthy of the blood
Draped over flesh
Cleansed from eternal infection
Decrepit flesh erodes
A murderer of myself
This slow torturous death
Revived in the absolute
I see this life fulfilled
Released from morbidity
I shall now remain
Nameless and faceless
Contorted from myself
Your identity is forever sealed within
