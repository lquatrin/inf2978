After thousand lies
I´m free of all desires
Without anyone that can
Remember me I´m alone
Even so I´m better than you
Cause I´m waiting for someone
Who holds the true spell
To kill all my sacred fears
Loved by false innocence
So much to forgive
There´s so much tears in vain
And the sword stays inside stone
I´ve been searching
For this moment
To show you
The song of our last farewell
