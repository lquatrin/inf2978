We were supposed to crash the gates
And at the last minute nothing was left
Some fall down
He was supposed to rebound
And sometimes good things happen
But not to this one 'cause we'll leave behind
Get out of our mind
It's too late
Who would stop me now?
You're tired
Who would stop me now?
Anger will come again
But this time I'll be ready
With all the positive banter I learned from you
Some fall down
