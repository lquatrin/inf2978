I don't doubt your heart
I won't make you tell
I won't break your arm
I won't make you cold
I won't waste your time
I don't think you're wrong
Already suffered
Enough to last for two lives
Not half as much as most guys
Mercy Mercy Mercy
You won't stay alone
You don't see yourself
You don't mean your words
Already suffered
Enough to last for two lives
Not half as much as most guys
Mercy Mercy Mercy
