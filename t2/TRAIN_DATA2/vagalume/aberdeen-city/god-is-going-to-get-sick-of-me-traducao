Caught, caught in the way
In the way of a bus
The lease is up. The lease is up
They break our legs to prove a point
The lease is up. The lease is over
A bible in one hand, he makes decisions
The lease is up
Ordered his gun and its done and its done and done
An Hysteric at the top
Saying everything is safe
Ordered his gun and its done and its done
Ordered his gun and its done and
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like it was my fault
Spend one more day backed into a corner
The lease is up
Impossible to lose support gets stronger
Each time something frightens them
You'll set it right
I know I know
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like his
You said I get it, i get it, i get it alright
And that nothing can be taken and that nothing can be taken from me
After I've stopped waiting for an ambulance to come and get me
God is Going to get sick of me
And the accident
That takes the beat from my heart
Will look like it was my fault
