Just staring at the ground
We were young
We were outnumbered
Twenty to one
It hurts right now
After a while
We will learn to give up our stregnth
And there's nothing to say
It's already too late
Where are you going?
And what will you wear?
Just stay and I'll say it again
It's no use
It's not you
We were young
We were outnumbered
Twenty to one
