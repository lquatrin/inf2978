Flashing that smile at random
Think you’re right cause you’re handsome
At least for another seven years
At least for another seven years
Won’t fight the face, stand in its place
Cover yourself when you see them
To be much safer when you meet again
Greater numbers are greater judges
And time has a way of settling grudges
Won’t fight the face, stand in its place
And they will stand all day to fight fight fight they’re fighting for nothing
And keep it still so they can fight fight fight they’re fighting for nothing
And never stop keep up the fight fight fight they’re fighting for nothing
And never stop keep up the fight fight fight they’re fighting for nothing
