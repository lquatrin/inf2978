And I know that there are miles
In between where we both are
But in my memories and dreams just know
You're never very far
Don't be upset we'll both be home soon
And we'll hold each other close
We'll stay up late
So I can tell you all the secrets no one knows
It's time to go to sleep now, love
You're the one that I'll be dreaming of
And all these miles and states
Can't separate us both forever
And I'll keep praying for the day
When we can simply be together
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight
Wishing that I could just be close
And catch the tears you shouldn't cry
I'll catch the tears you should not cry
I hold this photograph of us that I have seen so many times
And I just can't believe
That you would ever let me call you mine
I don't deserve you
And I'm pretty sure you know it in your heart
But if I ever feel alone I know just right where you are
And all these miles and states
Can't separate us both forever
And I'll keep praying for the day
When we can simply be together
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight
Wishing that I could just be close
And catch the tears you shouldn't cry
I'll catch the tears you should not cry
There is nothing that could keep me
From covering this distance
Hand in hand we run, so na√Øve in finding out what this is
Beautiful could never have a single thing on you
Just like the angel that you are
I could never live without you
It's time to go to sleep now, love
But you're the one that I'll be dreaming of
And all these miles and states
Can't separate us both forever
And I'll keep praying for the day
When we can simply be together
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight
Wishing that I could just be close
And catch the tears you shouldn't cry
I'll catch the tears you should not cry
And all these miles and states
Can't separate us both forever
And I'll keep praying for the day
When we can simply be together
Until then I'm holding on for you and you alone tonight
Wishing that I could just be close
And catch the tears you shouldn't cry
I'll catch the tears you should not cry
I'll catch the tears you should not cry
I'll catch the tears you shouldn't cry
Please don't cry
