Now it’s dancing in the shadow of your hope
Like apocalypse in the hands
In silence death passes through people eyes
Overlooking sky confessions
The man…the man and his instinct in a glass coffin…like
Like hate in a cold child wrist
Now it’s dancing in the shadow of your hope
Like evil embraced by the dark by the end…by the end
A very long day ignoring the sea i’m drowing in…i’m drowing in
Still playing…still playing with my wounds
Your hope…your hope disappears…like
Like into a snake mouth it’s trickle of blood and forgotten innocence
Swallow the purple of this late sunset
And pain won’t surprise you anymore when there will be no public
Any truth or lie increased by mirrors
Any truth or lie increased by mirrors
While the world is getting older in a ruins’ocean
In unsuspected agonies caressed by it’s purity
Like snow will stroke the grave just for one more time
Just…for one more time
Now it’s dancing in the shadow of your hope
This world is greased of tears
It digs a hole in our fragile chest.
