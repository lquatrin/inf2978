I'm starting to believe that there's a God and he hates me
I'm starting to believe that my mom
Lied about grace and divinity
And it hurts like a sunburn
Wakes me up from a deep sleep
I parked on the street out in front of st. Mary's
I watched people leave, from the mass in the evening
With my windows down
I can still hear the gospel choir singing
I stayed in the car, and the light
From the stained-glass window didn't reach me
The cicadas are deafening
Their voices caught in the breeze
You're not walking next to me
All alone is all I'll ever be
You're not walking next to me
I'm getting by
The only faith I had left was a lie
The leeches died, it turns out
My blood was poison the whole time
If someone bombed heaven
The sky would look like it did, tonight
All fractured and outlines
Get me out of here alive
