I'm stuck on a memory
Of you dancing in a backyard in North Jersey
You're holding sparklers
And silhouetted by the porch lights on a summer evening
So, while I'm pulling my gloves off with my teeth
It occurred to me you used to be happy
I curse the dashboard heat
It's fucking freezing
Asleep in the backseat
Oh god, I'm shaking. I'm empty
I feel so damn empty
I keep thinking
That I'll feel better when it's warmer across state lines
Now I'm scraping ice off of the windshield with a piece of broken taillight
Oh, I wouldn't quite call it homesick
but I keep seeing your face in the northbound traffic
I curse the dashboard heat
It's fucking freezing
Asleep in the backseat
Oh god, I'm shaking. I'm empty
I feel so damn empty
I'm gonna go to Georgia
I'm gonna smile in the sun
I'm gonna pick you some wild day-lilies
And I'm gonna hold on to them
I'm gonna keep them in my pocket
Til you let me back home
I'm gonna go to Georgia
And I'm coming back whole
I curse the dashboard heat
It's fucking freezing
Asleep in the backseat
Oh god, I'm shaking. I'm empty
I feel so damn empty
I curse the dashboard heat
It's fucking freezing
Asleep in the backseat
Oh god, I'm shaking. I'm empty
I feel so damn empty
