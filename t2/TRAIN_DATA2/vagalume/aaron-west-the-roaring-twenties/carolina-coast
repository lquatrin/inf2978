I woke up to shorebirds
I must be close to the sea
I walked through the parking lot
Felt the pavement burning my bare feet
I stumble out eastward
Pushed my way through the reeds
I woke up to shorebirds, I dreamed about drowning at sea
I'm staring out at nothing
Carolina coast
I'll wade through the shallows
It feels like I'm chasing your ghost
I think about drowning
I'd lay down and let go
I'll see you in heaven, everyone that left me alone
I reached in my pocket, to pull out a light
Forgot I threw out my smokes weeks ago
Oh I can't get it right
But I found your lilies
They're dead and they're dry
I'll plant 'em here seaside
I'll pray they come back to life
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
On the horizon
There's a boat fighting tide
All rust stained and pale blue
It's nearing the end of its life
But somehow it keeps floating
All banged up but alive
And I guess I feel better then
I won't lay down and die
I'm not coming home tonight, no
No I'm not coming home tonight, no
No I'm not coming home tonight
without dianne by my side, no
