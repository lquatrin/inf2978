I pictured our apartment
In the middle of Brooklyn
And I pictured the bedroom
And how the floor's still a mess
I pictured your office in mid-town manhattan
I pictured you walking in, I bet you're late again
But your make-up's straight and you're smiling
It's just like it's always been
I had lunch with your sister
And she told me it's over
That you're calling your lawyers, that you're not coming back
She says that she's sorry
Your whole family likes me
She don't know what you're thinking, but she knows that it's bad
So, I walked back home, turned the shower on
I let the washing machine turn the water cold
I'll read it over again, the lines of the note you left
I keep hoping that I'll forget
That the words changed while I slept
But I've got my doubts
You're staying at your parents house
Well I'm sleeping on the couch
I can't stand our bed without you
I found enough of your hairpins to build you a monument
A statue to loneliness, breathe it in, let it go
I caved a piece of the drywall in
Replaying the argument
I'm icing my swollen fist. It's a lie and this isn't a home, no, no
I'm just skin and bones
I broke my cell phon
Cause it won't fucking tell me when you're coming home
I'll read it over again, the lines of the note you left
I keep hoping that I'll forget
That the words changed while I slept
But I've got my doubts
You're staying at your parents house
Well I'm sleeping on the couch
I can't stand our bed without you
