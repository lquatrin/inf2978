People are starting to tear down their Christmas lights
It never got cold here, but they know that the season's died
I've been sleeping in a motel off 95
I don't really mind it much
The clerk at the desk is nice
Well he pours me a coffee and asks me if it's been a long night
I found a bar that's just outside the township line
I go there most every night
I drank my last paycheck dry
And outside, a homeless man asks me for change and I
I look him straight in his eyes
He starts to apologize
Tells me god's got a plan for me and that it'll be alright
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
The owner's been giving me a break on my rent this week
He says that I'm good for it. I joke how I'm probably
But I came up short again and nobody's laughing
So I'll sneak out at 2 am
I can't do it honestly
Well I know I'm a coward and I feel a bad night coming
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
I didn't know that I looked that pathetic
I didn't know
So, pour me another drink for a daughter I'll never meet
A wife who don't love me
And this cold cup of coffee
So pour me another drink and I'll count my blessings
I've got a half tank of gas left and this bottle ain't empty
