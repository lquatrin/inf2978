He told you lies for too long
Everyone could see it but you now
Now you know, he was wrong, oh yeah
He gave you all he can give
Oh I don't buy it like I'm stealing
Just run away, don't look back, no
Cause I don't wanna see another girl down
With her face in her hands crying out loud
Cause I don't wanna see it all again
Another girl's in danger of falling in love
With the wrong one, please shorty don't you rush
Cause you're so beautiful and it hurts too much
To see you cry again
I'm taking you away, starting here today
All you have to say is 'rescue me'
And I'm gonna save ya, save ya
Another girls in danger of falling in love
Save ya, save ya
Another girl's in danger

Is call my name shorty I'm coming
Straight to you and that's no lie
He did you wrong, I'll do you right
I just wanna be your superhero
And take a flight to you tonight
Cause I don't wanna see another girl down
With her face in her hands crying out loud
Cause I don't wanna see it all again
Another girl's in danger of falling in love
With the wrong one, please shorty don't you rush
Cause you're so beautiful and it hurts too much
To see you cry again
I'm taking you away, starting here today
All you have to say is 'rescue me'
And I'm gonna save ya, save ya
Another girls in danger of falling in love

You ain't really got to worry, you'll be in paradise
And if he got a problem, tell him come to Aaron
