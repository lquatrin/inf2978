Spendin' all my time
Ah nah nah nah nah ooh
Ah nah nah nah nah ooh
(ooh woah)
Spening all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Avery minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up
To when I lay down
All I got is you baby on my brain
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
25 hours in my day
The clock ain't long enough
On the wall
So I spend another minute with you
I'm not strong enough
That's why i fall
Everytime that I'm lookin' at you
You got my attention
I forgot to mention
You're the most beautiful girl I know
And I got no place to go
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Every minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up
To when I lay down
All I got is you baby on my brain
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
25 hours in my day
I got everything; I got nothing
If they take you away from me
I'm your medicine
Make you better when
All your hopes start runnin' away
Baby this is your song
No it's not the slow song
Say anything just to make you smile
Baby won't you stay awhile?
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Every minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up
To when I lay down
All I got is you baby on my brain
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
25 hours in my day
If you got somebody that you
Feel this way about say ooh
(say ooh)
And if you got somebody that you
Can't live without say ooh
(say ooh)
And if you got somebody that you
Feel this way about say ooh
Nah nah nah nah
(say ooh)
Nah nah nah nah
And if you got somebody that you
Can't live without say ooh
(say ooh)
I'm spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Every minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up
To when I lay down
All I got is you baby on my brain
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
25 hours in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Need a few more seconds in my day
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
Every minutes runnin' away
From when I wake up
To when I lay down
All I got is you baby on my brain
Spending all my time lovin' you
All my time lovin' you
25 hours in my day
