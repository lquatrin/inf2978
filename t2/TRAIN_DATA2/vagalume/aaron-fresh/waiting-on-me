Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Ay
Now I'm not like the type
To brag
But you gotta recognize
My swag
Saw me go from Mr. Who's he to Mr. Who's that
Now they can't keep their cool
And they don't know to act
It started on a Friday a little
After three
I got a phone call from
The homie
He said my video was on TV
And ever since then they can't
Keep their hands off me
I've got shawty's in the air
Waiting on me ever since they
Saw me in the A, U, C
I've got shawty's in Miami
Waiting on me ever since they
Saw me chilling on south beach
I've got shawty's in New York
Waiting on me ever since they
Saw my video on TV
I've got shawty's in LA
Waiting on me since they
Saw me shopping at the Beverly sea
Now it's hard to go any place
Without a shawty reconizing my face
It's kind of a hard to hide when
You got brown eyes
And your swagger be off
The chain
Yeah
Feels like a dream
Feels like a dream
Feels like a dream
And all these shawty's
All these shawty's want me
I'll guess be lonely
Because they own me
Because they own me
I've got shawty's in DC
Waiting on me since i did
That show in howard university
I've got shawty's in the Sha
Waiting on me ever since they
Saw me blowing through to windy sea
I've got shawty's in Detroit
Waiting on me ever since they
Heard me in ever you TV
I've got shawty's in Memphis
Waiting on me ever time they
Hear I'm comming back to Tennessee
Now if your that type of shawty
That sees what she wants
Say yeah
Yeah
And if you see what you want
Baby you ain't got to front
Say yeah
Yeah
And if you the type of shawty
That goes for what she wants
Say yeah
And if you know that you want me
Shawty just come up on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Waiting on me
On TV
Waiting on me
Waiting on me
On TV
Waiting on me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Baby would you wait for me
