[Chorus]
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
Everything was alright, alright
Everything was all good, yea
You was always by my side, by my side
And I would never be good yea
All the kissing and hugging, wish we didn't do that
Cause you tell me how we hit and now you're runnin' right back
Girl I cant take this no more
So I guess I gotta let the rain pour
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought of telling that your boyfriend aint real
But baby who don't tag a feel
I'm just sayin you already noticing
Forgive me if I'm wrong
[Chorus]
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
So why you callin' me now?
I put the phone on vibrate so I wouldn't hear a sound but uh
To see your picture come up
My heart single but my friends seem to give up
And I'm like
I wish we didn't start as friends
That way this relationship would be much easier to end
And I'm sorry
But no need to pretend
I could find a next girl, give my love once again
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought of telling that your boyfriend aint real
But baby who don't tag a feel
I'm just sayin you already noticing
Forgive me if I'm wrong
Chorus]
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
Just let the rain fall down down down
All the all the way down down down
Let the rain fall down down down
On her
