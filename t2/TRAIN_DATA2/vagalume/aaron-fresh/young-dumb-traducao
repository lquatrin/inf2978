I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
wanna party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
[Chorus]
Girl I know you're the one
and for this people wait there whole life
I know they're seeing I'm young and dumb
but I'm really just having some fun (having some fun)
SO I call up my name, yeah know I'm wrong
I should even be here singing this song
but you wouldn't be here all night long, but I will
hold up I'm tripping
I don't know what I want, at this party thing don't get on
and then maybe then number one I'll be home
till I
(Ball up, till I fall out
ain't holla back, I'm going all out
if you're in love with me, like you say you be
all the ladies in the club let me hear you shout)
But you feel me, feel me
came with my brother I'm 19
my hearts seem that is wrong and my brain says
is the right thing
Chorus]
Girl I know you're the one
and for this people wait there whole life
I know they're seeing I'm young and dumb
but I'm really just having some fun (having some fun)
SO I need to be on every vacay
Vegas spring break, losing you would be a mistake
but girl that's a risk that I will take
I'm wrong so wrong I know, ain't no got it
but I'm so young, so young, so young
I'm just being honest
and I know I might be asking for too much
but you try and stay girl if you're really in love, uh
'cause girl you're special and I know you're the one
but I can't give it all the
when I'm having so much fun
Chorus]
Girl I know you're the one
and for this people wait there whole life
I know they're seeing I'm young and dumb
but I'm really just having some fun (having some fun)
But I know you've been getting so mad
and is such a feeling so sad
when I go like that
act like I ain't coming right back
I'm not losing you, I'm choosing you
doing her and do you
I just wanna act the fool and it's what I gotta do
Chorus]
Girl I know you're the one
and for this people wait there whole life
I know they're seeing I'm young and dumb
but I'm really just having some fun (having some fun)
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
wanna party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I kinda party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
wanna party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
I party and bullshit, ain't kick it with a couple of my
