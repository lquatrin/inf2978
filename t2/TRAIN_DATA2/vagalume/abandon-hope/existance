uh, this is one in ten – I grew tall
no way for me to spill it then – tried it all
but it was then when I lead – lead to a
faithfull horizon – a burden to shake your
spine – a burden to cross – to cross that line
I knew it – I should have known – your
true believe is yet unknown
the way you haunt me – with your views
is uncompared and is told abuse
and now here I come again – open mind against the grain
to just even up score – and to make it feel – feel like all before
precious little fool – wait outside the room –
hold your breath for long – let slip with a shiny tune
you toy around with me – while you shouldn´t do -
´cause I can´t get that calm – to again get through to you
and I can´t see – that you feel to give in –
that´s not what frightens – it´s this unholy grin
you ain´t think you're wrong – well I proof you wrong –
it´s a somewhat steep cliff – you´re walking on
and now here I come again – open mind against the grain
to just even up score – and to make it feel – feel like all before
been dropped – been fooled – been anxious for the second loop
been packed – been stuffed – been wrenched between the roughest slack
what is it, you really know ? – again: could it be really shown?
crippled - with the only sight that´s left – betrayed?
the rest is peeled – the rest is just me
you can easily forget - ´cause this cannot be
this rest is only saved by word – words so many lost –
lost inside – inside this crippled world
been forced – been hated – been through with friendship credit
been liked – been gripped – been often badly tripped
what is it, you really know ? – again: could it be really shown?
crippled - with the only sight that´s left – betrayed?
you see me – you hear me – I know you
you feel me – I feel you
you see me – you hear me – I know you
you feel me – I feel you – this is you
