Ever been, a red-burned so-to-call – ridin´ high, swaying through the hall
a jacked-up mind, with the winning smile – rags to riches – downhill style
got the news – I felt lost – I was helpless – could not believe my ears –
and I bowed and I swore this could never be – so I banned my tears
live so innocent is taken – so innocent is taken
with the eyes turned down – knowing that you’re gone
lost – but not forgotten
hate to see this world without you
lost – but not forgotten
the unbearable adds to your life
like never before, I felt an alignment, felt the broken-up root
and listening to him left me telling myself: Yeah, I know you
psycho, hatred, and arms – always disastrous – all of this is true
mourning mingling with harsh reality – had to learn to let it go
live so innocent is taken – so innocent is taken
with the eyes turned down – knowing that you’re gone
lost – but not forgotten
hate to see this world without you
lost – but not forgotten
the unbearable adds to your life
live so innocent is taken – so innocent is taken
with the grief still strong – hear the unsung song
live so innocent is taken – so innocent is taken
with the eyes turned down – knowing that you’re gone
lost – but not forgotten
hate to see this world without you
lost – but not forgotten
the unbearable adds to your life
