to leave a place – a place like this
a place always admired
is a piercing pain – cause what lies ahead,
is so unsure to be seen
head looks through the fallin`rain
memorizing the maze
some fallen angels guide that ally
puzzled by a million ways
Wait!
sit and wait is just bad advice
but the masses cling to this
what urges you? what makes you grief
over? are just with this?
depressed in you – believe is new –
counted down – but reply is due
believe it - believe it – believe it –
sloth is just sweet shit
what bothers, what´s that differs?
heard it all before
regardless of what you think or do
fate's demanding more
depressed in you – believe is new –
counted down – but reply is due
believe it - believe it – believe it –
sloth is just sweet shit
the way down here – confessions made –
broken face – call just once
the way down here – confessions made –
broken face – call just once
I knew this rotten place – a place like
noone wants to know
a lot to speculate on what´s the game
and I don't wanna cause this thing - to
happen all again – cause this still reads
across my name
head looks through the fallin`rain
memorizing the maze
some fallen angels guide that ally
puzzled by a million ways
