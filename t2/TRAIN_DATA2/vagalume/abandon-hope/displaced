it’s been years since you have all become so hard
but this time you ain´t feel it’s wrong
the time has come for you to play the final card
next chance it would be - years - to - come
like a thief - you’ve wandered through the dark at night
using the shadows - of the darkened doorways
can hardly stand - the big temptations all around
you watch the flickering lights - through melted glass
Not everything - will enfold this way just because you have said so
´cause everything – is just part of the stream – we just follow
this is it - what we’ve all been waiting for
but you know, there ain´t a better place to be
brought to life, has left you running for the door
closing the gap to – pay the fee
start up new – you don’t know what you’re headed for
you can’t control – the feelings emerging within your soul
bright as can be – you anticipate the story´s core
you rewrite the script – to replace the author´s role
Not everything - will enfold this way just because you have said so
´cause everything – is just part of the stream – we just follow
Hu – the temper´s lost – now – the time is up –
Down – this questions´ cause – but these ways we just follow
Not everything - will enfold this way just because you have said so
´cause everything – is just part of the stream – we just follow
like a thief - you’ve wandered through the dark at night
using the shadows - of the darkened doorways
can hardly stand - the big temptations all around
you watch the flickering lights - through melted glass
