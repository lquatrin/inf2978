filing grace
unforetold
`this right – this just got it rolled
be back on a scene – been back on a role
stooped forward then – and ripped out your own soul
backlayed from delusion – haunted, restless ghost –
sit on my face and then wait – and watch it go!
Feel the climax – brought to a new extent!
yeah – we're going back in…
celebrity nudes – paparazzis` gold
> We bring it to you <
the latest shit` just been sold
parameters go – parameters cease
truth an decline –
must certainly be one of these
no – yeah – no – not yet!
no – yeah – no – not yet!
the problem rests within ourselves
and how we cling to everythin` that sells
so satiated with a life without meaning
we search for the light – in a darkening ceiling
been crippled – been earth quaked – been alone without a home
been tortured – been outraged – been in a needle in the hay
been refuged – been fucked by – been a lot wiser now
been murdered – been sacred – been tangled with the latest crap
when did you look at the sky at last?
press is bought – not – to question authority
tentacles weaving on a dead democrats` autopsy
you're loaded dice, rolled for mother justice
caught between the Scylla and Charibdis
