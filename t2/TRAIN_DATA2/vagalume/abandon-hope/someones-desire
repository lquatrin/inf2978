Just explain me, what you’ve done
Don’t weep – for it’ll just come undone
I foresee a beautiful time
With you on the wall and me on your mind
Controlled – despite the pain
Controlled – close your eyes again
My failure – hope you will not see
My failure – don’t speak to me
My failure – i will recant what you demand
I´ve come – to come undone
I caress your precious hair – it’s me who’s there and nowhere
Don’t dream – for it will not end this way – this day
Dispossessed – yearn to feel the fire
Dispossessed – by someone’s desire
My failure – hope you will not see
My failure – don’t speak to me
My failure – i will recant what you demand
I´ve come – to come undone
So you dream of a simple answer – you crave to see
There’s the iron ring - to bent the unrighteous free
To save them from the world – we’ve secluded all of thee
And now they dwell – in a velvet cage but truly free
In a velvet cage but truly free
My failure – hope you will not see
My failure – don’t speak to me
My failure – i will recant what you demand
I´ve come – to come undone
