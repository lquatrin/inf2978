I think it’s best to believe – that underneath - there appears a void
the entity of beast – burden to your soul
crying all so limitless – so downtrodden – so suppressed
and it’s like saying – we wagered far too less
black mill - on the hill - reaping those best to come –
this place - deserted – right now, I’m still here
I think it’s best to believe – that underneath – there appears a void
aghast at this sight – into the infinite night
black mill - on the hill - reaping those best to come –
this place - deserted – right now, I’m still here
black mill - on the hill – taking all like they were one –
this place - corrupted – right now, all this ends
can’t look into the water – this shallow, brown stream - flows right next to me
can’t look beneath the surface – it’s hard to bear – not to follow the trace
praise all but one – mature once a year – a ray of light to come
brought to bend my knee – before this red-plated sun
black mill - on the hill - reaping those best to come –
this place - deserted – right now, I’m still here
black mill - on the hill – taking all like they were one –
this place - corrupted – right now, all this ends
