devine creatures in a pleasant set
distorted vulture with the smile
managed just to hover ´bove the scene
distracted by an unexspected grip
you said: - all´s not lookin good
expect nothin` you wanted change
the most occurred so much demanding
that less was yet arranged
but all was said and talked
well over and commited
to happen in between
with only one thing on their minds
you think you`re all so cle-ver
you think: Damn, I'm all so right
better come down from that grid
revealing what is true
Ahr, what you want - is not
and what you say – is not
and what you feel – is not
Your real YOU
Ahr, what you want - is not
and what you say – is not
and what you feel – is not
Your real YOU
you think you're all so cle-ver
you think: Damn, I'm all so right
better come down from that grid
now - let's see…
you spent hours with yourself
but you found it less rewarding
to try push forward to a core
you now believe is never to be found
you better check it out - before I come
and grip it and burn it just before your eyes
and watch it melt away – droping from
your hands – for one unsacred sake
you think you're all so cle-ver
you think: Damn, I'm all so right
better come down from that grid
revealing what is true
Ahr, what you want - is not
and what you say – is not
and what you feel – is not
Your real YOU
Ahr, what you want - is not
and what you say – is not
and what you feel – is not
Your real YOU
want you want – what you say –
what you feel – it ain´t your real you
