this place is a raging court
lone tenders in a stuffened pit
I see no one’s deliberate
but truly needs deliverance
believe is untold, the dream is on hold, and the story’s about to end here
this drain is so strong, the endless day’s so long – it makes you wonder how you cope
When loneliness calls from the depths of infinity
A memory so strong it haunts me so bad
A whispering voice from the inside is urging me
Remember the sad, the damned and the dead
emerging from a waste land
this court is right close at hand
bleeding as you arise
the new dusk invites the night
I know this one, it will give me strength, not to hide from these faces
red line in your face, just to stare and gaze, presence of somethin´ unknown
When loneliness calls from the depths of infinity
A memory so strong it haunts me so bad
A whispering voice from the inside is urging me
Remember the sad, the damned and the dead
up on a dream, I held within me
down to the stream, I float across thee
I always wanted a life, I’ve never accomplished
never to wake again is my only wish
When loneliness calls from the depths of infinity
A memory so strong it haunts me so bad
A whispering voice from the inside is urging me
Remember the sad, the damned and the dead
