see this park site - nothing’s changed
how many times – don’t know - but now I pass again
I have had that one approach – I have had that one good deed –
to try and get a life – to find me what I need
all wasted time and gone so long - I tried on, and on, and on …
all wasted time and gone so long - but it’s gone
same road – different day – countin` miles – taking me far away
kiss goodbye – a love embraced – find me here – remembering your face
read my mind – simple as that
thoughts deceiving – been just false to get
drivin´ through the night’s divide - left to my own devices –
ride the endless ride - anyone read me now – ´cause I grow weary
all wasted time and gone so long - I tried on, and on, and on …
all wasted time and gone so long - but it’s gone
same road – different day – countin` miles – taking me far away
kiss goodbye – a love embraced – find me here – remembering your face
this longing I can’t bear - good moments still so rare
these people that drag me down - to what I never wanted to become
this hurting deep inside me – you’re looking straight through me
this one big time we’ve had – how fine - but now somehow dismantled
all night around – just alone with the road - I summon lights to talk to me
- is this freedom or my misery
cheap amusement – cheap motel – the endless ride’s my destiny
- the road’s a whore – that knows no dignity
burning the bridges – it’s just what I know –
feels like I’m sentenced – on this way down
I can’t fight it – it’s the way it is – these dark hours will just pass
- soon I’ll fall into your arms and rest
burning the bridges – it’s just what I know –
feels like I’m sentenced – on this way down
burning all bridges – always dive into the flow
never tasted a fountain - `gotta change it somehow
