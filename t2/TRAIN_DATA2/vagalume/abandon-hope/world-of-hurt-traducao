a life is lost – you stare and watch – waiting for the things to come
no place to hide – see father’s anger at the highest tide – who will be the one to shut my eyes?
I know the pain in your heart – I know all the fears tearing you apart
take one step – closer to the edge - take a step into my world
salvation lies – in a body-bag - salvation from this – world of hurt
now no one can do you a harm - asleep in a place of security
where all your sorrows are fading away
lost – in misery – framed in a tragic picture – from where came that anger?
No one escapes – a torment sealed as fate – these times you don’t dare to remember
I know the pain in your heart – I know all the fears tearing you apart
take one step – closer to the edge - take a step into my world
salvation lies – in a body-bag - salvation from this – world of hurt
now no one can do you a harm - asleep in a place of security
where all your sorrows are fading away
a light bulb on its way – it drives and rolls and tumbles
a short descent – a crescent glimpse away – a distant thunder rumbles
now up and fast – across the gulf of space – cast eternal grace – cast eternal grace
you cannot just – run away – or hide away – you cannot dare
so you just – inhale the air – and don’t stop to stare – no, you cannot dare
take one step – closer to the edge - take a step into my world
salvation lies – in a body-bag - salvation from this – world of hurt
now no one can do you a harm - asleep in a place of security
where all your sorrows are fading away
