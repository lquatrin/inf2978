There's a desperation, Crying from my soul,
Come and take this mind Lord, renew it make me whole,
Let there be a hunger, That breaks this heart of stone,
As I join with the Angels, All around your Throne,
Chorus:
Give me your mind, Give me your heart,
You be my King, Let a cleansing start,
Give me your mind, Come make me whole,
And let freedom be the cry of my soul,
Let repentance cry, From my heart today,
Renew my mind with yours, in every single way,
With new eyes of glory, let us see you now,
Every tongue and nation, teach us how to bow,
Fears and worries, Consume my mind,
Troubled deeply, In the sin you will find,
Theres a strugle, To give you everything,
Change my mind Lord, And let Freedom start to sing
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lamb
