The poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way
That i could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all
You're a legend
I guess i'll never get
A chance to know you
Still you're close as can be
Make the bandstand
To a dreamland
Rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
Let your feet dance
Rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down
Nobody's standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us screaming
Look at your fans
How we love you
Rubber ball man
