We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie 
So what's the use to pretend 
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy 
You've gotta face it my friend 
Dream world 
You've been living in a dream world 
Trust me 
You just can't escape from reality 
Boy meets girl 
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world 
Here I am, there you are, we've gotta make it together 
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better 
When you reach out 
And you say to me 
How I love you girl 
When I hold you 
Baby can't you see 
It's a real dream world 
You had your hopes and your high expectations 
Somehow it doesn't seem right 
I'm getting fed up with your accusations 
I'm not your angel in white 
Dream world 
You've been living in a dream world 
Trust me 
You just can't escape from reality 
Boy meets girl 
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world 
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together 
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better 
When you reach out 
And you say to me 
How I love you girl 
When I hold you 
Baby can't you see 
That's a real dream world 
Dream world 
You've been living in a dream world 
Trust me 
You just can't escape from reality 
Boy meets girl 
Doesn't mean they're in a dream world 
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
