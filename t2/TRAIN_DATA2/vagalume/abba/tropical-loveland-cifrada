Come to my loveland, wander along 
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs 
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand 
Listen to bluebirds, won't you come to my land 
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue 
My paradise is waiting here for you 
It's a tropical loveland 
I wanna share it with you 
Life can be funny 
Happy and sunny 
In my tropical loveland 
Come to my loveland, wander with me 
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree 
Over the rainbow, under the moon 
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon 
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything 
The secrets that my paradise can bring 
It's a tropical loveland 
I wanna share it with you 
Life can be funny 
Happy and sunny 
In my tropical loveland 
It's a tropical loveland 
I wanna share it with you 
(I wanna share it with you) 
It's a tropical loveland 
(It's a tropical loveland) 
I wanna share it with you 
It's a tropical loveland
