Suzy was nine and I was ten
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us from school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
"we don't want to hurt you girl
But you'd better
Look for a friend of your own
Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown
Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around"
Suzy ran home to mama's arms
Mama said "look, she's never done you no harm
So get off her back and let her be
Why can't you play together in harmony?"
We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said
"look for a friend of your own
Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown
Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around"
