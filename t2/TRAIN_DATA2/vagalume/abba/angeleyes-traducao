Last night I was taking
A walk along the river
And I saw him
Together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her
Made me shiver
'cause he always used to
Look at me that way
And I thought
Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he likes to play
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought I
Could never live without him
And I wonder
Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back all the pain
How can I forget that name
Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
He took my heart
And now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no
(keep thinking
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking I had to pay the price)
