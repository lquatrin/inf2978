I'm Frida, hello!
I'm the star of the show
That's what she thinks anyway
And I like to perform
Benny says I am warm
Well, hot is the least you can say
Independent and free
And ambitious, that's me
Fighting for fame and success
And I'm tough too, you see
No she's not, just ask me
Singing and dancing
Is what like best
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok
So is she
Singing together in harmony
He is a B
She's a bird
"Fiddle-dee-dee"
Yes you heard
We are a simple four letter word
A-B-B-A 
I'm Bj√∂rn, I'm the guy
Who is careful and shy
Don't like to spend every dime
But I love my guitar
And I drive in my car
Scares me to death every time
And I don't like to shave
You should live in a cave
No, I feel more at home on the stage
When I sing and I play
With my group it's ok
You're group? You're kidding?
Or is it your age?
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok
So is she
Singing together in harmony
He is a B
She's a bird
" Fiddle-dee-dee" 
Yes you heard
We are a simple four letter word
A-B-B-A 
Two and two together make four
Every song opens a door
I am an A
I am a B
I am a B
I am an A 
I'm Agnetha, hello !
I'm the young one you know
And she never lets me forget
I am gentle and mild
Underneath it I'm wild
Craziest woman I've met
I'm romantic they say
But it's not quite that way
I'm down to earth, yes indeed
And I like early nights
So I turn off the lights
And I never get any chances to read
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok
So is she
Singing together in harmony
He is a B
She's a bird
Fiddle-dee-dee
Yes you heard
We are a simple four letter word
A-B-B-A 
I'm Benny at last
And I'm living quite fast
I like to travel and sea
I can play day and night
If the feeling's all right
And it's sometimes a problem for me
I can play 'In The Mood'
I like wine, I like food
Now that's something 
He just can't deny
But I'm the talented one
With a place in the sun
When he's not bragging
He's quite a nice guy
I am an A
I'm a B
He is ok
So is she
Singing together in harmony
I am an A
I'm a B
He is okay
So is she
Singing together in harmony
He is a B
She's a bird
"Fiddle-dee-dee"
Yes you heard
We are a simple four letter word
A-B-B-A
