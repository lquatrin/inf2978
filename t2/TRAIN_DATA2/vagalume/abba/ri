I was sitting by the phone 
I was waiting all alone 
baby by myself 
I sit and wait and wonder about you 
it?s a dark and dreary night 
seems like nothing?s going right 
won?t you tell me honey 
how can I go on here without you 
yes, I?m down and feeling blue 
and I don?t know what to do, oh-oh 
Ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call 
ring, ring 
the happiest sound of them all 
ring, ring 
I stare at the phone on the wall 
and I sit all alone impatiently 
won?t you please understand the need in me 
so, ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call 
so, ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call 
You were here and now you?re gone 
hey did I do something wrong 
I just can?t believe that I could be 
so badly mistaken 
was it me or was it you 
tell me, are we really through 
won?t you hear me cry 
and you will know that my heart is breaking 
please forgive and then forget 
or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh 
Ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call 
ring, ring 
the happiest sound of them all 
ring, ring 
I stare at the phone on the wall 
and I sit all alone impatiently 
won?t you please understand the need in me 
so, ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call 
so, ring, ring 
why don?t you give me a call
