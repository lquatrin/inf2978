I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything
If you see the wonder
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future
Even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in
Everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time
Is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I have a dream
A fantasy
To help me through
Reality
And my destination
Makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness
Still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in
Everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time
Is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
