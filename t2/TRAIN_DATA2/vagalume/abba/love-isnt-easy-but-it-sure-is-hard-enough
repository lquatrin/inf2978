?Do you remember the first time 
And all of your sweet, sweet talk? 
Ain?t heard it a lot since then, love? 
?Now look at that guy 
He?s making me cry 
He leaves every morning 
And he hardly says goodbye? 
But if I would have to choose 
I wouldn?t let you go 
Just give it some more time 
And you will see our love will grow 
Darling, I know 
We gotta have patience 
Love isn?t just a sensation 
Some of the time it gets rough 
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough 
(sweet sweet our love is bitter sweet) 
Giving love is the reason for living 
But a few things can be tough 
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough 
(sweet sweet our love is bitter sweet) 
?From the first moment I saw you 
I?ve treated you like a queen 
I?ve given you lots of presents? 
?Now listen to that 
Just look at that cat 
You?d think he was an angel 
But he?s talking through his hat? 
But if I would have to choose 
I wouldn?t let you go 
Just give it some more time 
And you will see our love will grow 
Darling I know 
We gotta have patience 
Love isn?t just a sensation 
Some of the time it gets rough 
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough 
(sweet sweet our love is bitter sweet) 
Giving love is the reason for living 
But a few things can be tough 
Love isn?t easy but it sure is hard enough 
(sweet sweet our love is bitter sweet)
