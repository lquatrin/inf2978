I hear the door-bell ring
And suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously
Tearing through the silence
I cannot move I'm standing numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me
The signal's sounding once again
And someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices smiling
Now I hear them moving, muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm crackin' up voices growing louder
Irritation building and I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now
I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling going crazy
There is no escaping now
I'm crackin' up
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me
Now I hear them moving, muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm crackin' up voices growing louder
Irritation building and I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now
I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling going crazy
There is no escaping now
I'm crackin' up
