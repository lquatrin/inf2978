You think you? re gonna make me softer
With your fancy car, ahaha
But I can tell you all your tricks
Ain? t gonna get you far, ahaha
They say that money? s got a magic touch
But not to me it doesn? t mean that much
You won? t have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright
So long, see you honey
Can? t buy me with your money
Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy
But i? ll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
Can? t buy me with your money
You know it? s not worth tryin?
So long, so long, so long
You didn? t have to send me flowers
Like you did today, ahaha
I wouldn? t keep a thing from you
I gave them all away, ahaha
The girls might fall for everything you? ve got
But I? m not one of them, you know I? m not
You won? t have me tonight
Alright, alright, alright, alright
So long, see you honey
Can? t buy me with your money
Tracy, Daisy, they may be crazy
But i? ll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
Can? t buy me with your money
You know it? s not worth tryin?
So long, so long, so long
