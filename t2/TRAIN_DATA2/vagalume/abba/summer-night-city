Summer night city 
summer night city 
Waiting for the sunrise 
soul dancin? in the dark 
summer night city 
walkin? in the moonlight 
love-makin? in a park 
summer night city 
In the sun I feel like sleepin? 
I can?t take it for too long 
my impatience slowly creepin? 
up my spine and growin? strong 
I know what?s waiting there for me 
tonight I?m loose and fancy free 
ah
When the night comes with the action 
I just know it?s time to go 
can?t resist the strange attraction 
from that giant dynamo 
lots to take and lots to give 
time to breathe and time to live 
Waiting for the sunrise 
soul dancin? in the dark 
summer night city 
walkin? in the moonlight 
love-makin? in a park 
summer night city 
It?s elusive call it glitter 
somehow something turns me on 
some folks only see the litter 
we don?t miss ?em when they?re gone 
I love the feeling in the air 
my kind of people everywhere 
ah
When the night comes with the action 
I just know it?s time to go 
can?t resist the strange attraction 
from that giant dynamo 
and tomorrow when it?s dawning 
and the first birds start to sing 
in the pale light of the morning 
nothing?s worth remembering 
it?s a dream, it?s out of reach 
scattered driftwood on a beach 
Waiting for the sunrise 
soul dancin? in the dark 
summer night city 
walkin? in the moonlight 
love-makin? in a park 
summer night city
