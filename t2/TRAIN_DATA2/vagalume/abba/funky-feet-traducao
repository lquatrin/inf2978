Oh, oh I feel fine
here with you
having a real good time
Oh, oh you're so good
nice to me
just like a lover should
all I need's a bit of you
ooh a bit of boogie too
ooh won't you please
follow me
let the music
set your body free
Give me that sound so sweet
give me that dancing beat
don't you know baby I got funky feet
if that music's sweet
honey I feel complete
don't you know baby
I got funky feet
Oh, oh I want more
come with me
get on the dancing floor
Oh, oh watch me now
you can learn
I'm gonna show you how
all I need's a bit of you
ooh a bit of boogie too
ooh close your eyes
hear my play
let the music
carry you away
Give me that sound so sweet
give me that dancing beat
don't you know baby
I got funky feet
if that music's sweet
honey I feel complete
don't you know baby I got funky feet
Close your eyes
hear my play
Let the music
carry you away
Give me that sound so sweet
give me that dancing beat
don't you know baby
I got funky feet
if that music's sweet
honey I feel complete
don't you know baby
I got funky feet
