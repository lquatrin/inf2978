They came flyin? from faraway 
Now I?m under their spell 
I love hearing the stories that they tell 
They?ve seen places beyond my land 
And they?ve found new horizons 
They speak strangely but I understand 
And I dream I?m an eagle 
And I dream I can spread my wings 
Flyin? high, high 
I?m a bird in the sky 
I?m an eagle that rides on the breeze high, high 
What a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please 
As all good friends we talk all night 
And we fly wing to wing 
I have questions and they know everything 
There?s no limit to what I feel 
We climb higher and higher 
Am I dreamin? or is it all real 
Is it true I?m an eagle 
Is it true I can spread my wings 
Flyin? high, high 
I?m a bird in the sky 
I?m an eagle that rides on the breeze high, high 
What a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please
