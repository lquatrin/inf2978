They passed me by 
all of those great romances 
you were, I felt 
robbing me of my rightful chances 
my picture clear 
everything seemed so easy 
and so I dealt you the blow 
one of us had to go 
now it's different 
I want you to know 
One of us is crying 
one of us is lying 
in her lonely bed 
staring at the ceiling 
wishing she was 
somewhere else instead 
one of us is lonely 
one of us is only 
waiting for a call 
sorry for herself 
feeling stupid feeling small 
wishing she had never left at all 
I saw myself 
as a concealed attraction 
I felt you kept me away 
from the heat and the action 
just like a child 
stubborn and misconceiving 
that's how I started the show 
one of us had to go 
now I've changed and 
I want you to know 
One of us is crying 
one of us is lying 
in her lonely bed 
staring at the ceiling 
wishing she was 
somewhere else instead 
one of us is lonely 
one of us is only 
waiting for a call 
sorry for herself 
feeling stupid feeling small 
wishing she had never left at all 
never left at all
