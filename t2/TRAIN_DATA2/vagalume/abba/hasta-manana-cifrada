Where is the spring and the summer 
That once was yours and mine 
Where did it go 
I just don't know 
But still my love for you will live forever 
Hasta Mañana 'til we meet again 
Don't know where, don't know when 
Darling, our love was much too strong to die 
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow 
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
 
I can't do without you 
Time to forget, send me a letter 
Say you forgive, the sooner the better 
Hasta Mañana, baby, Hasta Mañana, until then 
Where is the dream we were dreaming 
And all the nights we shared 
Where did they go 
I just don't know 
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you 
Hasta Mañana 'til we meet again 
Don't know where, don't know when 
Darling, our love was much too strong to die 
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow 
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again 
I can't do without you 
Time to forget, send me a letter 
Say you forgive, the sooner the better 
Hasta Mañana, baby, Hasta Mañana, until then 
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again 
I can't do without you 
Time to forget, send me a letter 
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
