Nina, Pretty Ballerina 
Every day in the morning 
on her way to the office 
you can see her as she catches a train 
just a face among a million faces 
just another woman with no name 
not the girl you’d remember 
but she’s still something special 
if you knew her I am sure you’d agree 
’cause I know she’s got a little secret 
Friday evening she turns out to be: 
Nina, pretty ballerina 
now she is the queen of the dancing floor 
this is the moment she’s waited for 
just like Cinderella 
Nina, pretty ballerina 
who would ever think she could be this way 
this is the part that she likes to play 
but she knows the fun would go away 
if she would play it every day 
So she’s back every morning 
to her work at the office 
and another week to live in a dream 
and another row of early mornings 
in an almost never-ending stream 
doesn’t talk very often 
kind of shy and uncertain 
everybody seems to think she’s a bore 
but they wouldn’t know her little secret 
what her Friday night would have in store 
Nina, pretty ballerina 
now she is the queen of the dancing floor 
this is the moment she’s waited for 
just like Cinderella 
Nina, pretty ballerina 
who would ever think she could be this way 
this is the part that she likes to play 
she would like to play it every day
