Tell me Pedro
Why did you leave
Still I've got your white sombrero
In your eyes
I believed I'd found my hero
But I know some day you'll regret
You'll return to your seorita
Happy as you can be in the arms of Rosalita
Oh, Alfredo
Give me the truth
Go and find my darling Pedro
I'm your friend
You're the one - my caballero
Pedro's never sure of himself
- where to find a sweet seorita
Saddle your horse my dear
bring him back to Rosalita
Oh, my Pedro
You and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
and the scars they're leavin'
We'll be dancin' once again
and the pain will end
There will be no time for grievin'
Oh, my Pedro
No, I won't cry 'cause the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Sing once more
Like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Then the walls came tumblin' down
when Alfredo blew the candle All is gone but it's not too hard to handle
Oh, my Pedro
Tell me the truth
Rosalita won't be a feather
I see
you're so happy gay together
Oh, my Pedro
No, I won't cry 'cause the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
Sing once more
Like you did before
in the arms of Rosalita
