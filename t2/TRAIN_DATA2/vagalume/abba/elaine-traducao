You hate
You scream
You swear
And still you never reach? em
You curse
You try to scare
But you can never teach? em
It? s a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You know they? re gonna get you
You try to break away
But they will never let you
It? s a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You? re like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They? ll take your soul
You come
You stay
You go
It really doesn? t matter
You? ve done it all before
By now they know the pattern
It? s a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You? re like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They? ll take your soul
Nowhere to go
You know they? re gonna get you
Nowhere to go
You know they? ll never let you
It? s a dead end street
They tie your hands
And tie your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane
A nowhere train for
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You? re like a goldfish in a bowl
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind
They? ll take your soul
Nowhere to go
You know they? re gonna get you
Nowhere to go
You know they? ll never let you
