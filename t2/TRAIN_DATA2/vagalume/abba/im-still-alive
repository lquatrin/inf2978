I was a loser then
But I m a winner now
I'd do it all again
? cause now I know how
How everything in life
Comes down to this at last
Survivin' and livin'
Determined not to give in
And
I'm still alive
My life is rollin' on
Gently from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
And my mind is slowly wakin'
And my heart has ceased its achin?
I'm still alive
I took so many blows
I cried a sea of tears
And only heaven knows
How I could stand the fears
I think of all the nights
I lay alone and scared
All shattered, and cryin'
And thinkin' I was dyin'
But
I'm still alive
My life is rollin' on
Gently from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
And my mind is slowly wakin'
And my heart has ceased its achin?
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
My life is rollin' on
Gently from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
And my mind is slowly wakin'
And my heart has ceased its achin?
I'm still alive
I? m still alive
I? m still alive
