Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
I watch her go
With a surge of
That well known sadness
And I have to sit down
For a while
The feeling that I'm
Losing her forever
And without really
Entering her world
I'm glad whenever I
Can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
I try to capture
Every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Do I really see what's
In her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Sleep in our eyes
Her and me
At the breakfast table
Barely awake I
Let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
There's that odd
Melancholy feeling
And a a sense of
Guilt I can't deny
What happened to the
Wonderful adventures
The places I had
Planned for us to go
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't
And why I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
I try to capture
Every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Do I really see what's
In her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
All the time
Sometimes I wish
That I could freeze
The picture
And save it from
The funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home
In the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
