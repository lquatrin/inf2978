He had what you might call a trivial occupation 
he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station 
with no romance in his life - sometimes he wished he had a wife 
He read the matrimonial advertising pages 
the cries for help from different people, different ages 
but they had nothing to say, at least not until the day, 
when something special he read, this is what it said 
If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get 
two for the price of one 
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get 
two for the price of one 
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with the two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't call us and you'll get two)
He called the number and a voice said "Alice Whiting" 
the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting 
he was amazed at his luck, the purest streak of gold he'd struck 
He said, I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling 
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling 
why don't we meet for a chat, the three of us in my flat 
I can't forget what I read 
this is what it said 
If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get 
two for the price of one 
We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get 
two for the price of one 
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with the two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't call us and you'll get two)
She said I'm sure we must be perfect for each other 
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain
When you meet my mother"
