I have a very good friend 
The kind of girl 
Who likes to follow a trend 
She has a personal style 
Some people like it 
Others tend to go wild 
You hear her voice everywhere 
Taking the chair 
She?s a leading lady 
And with no trace of hesitation 
She keeps going 
Head over heels 
Breaking her way 
Pushing through unknown 
Jungles every day 
She?s a girl 
With a taste for the world 
(the world is like a playing-ground 
Where she goes rushing) 
Head over heels 
Setting the pace 
Running the gauntlet 
In a whirl of lace 
She?s extreme 
If you know what I mean 
Her man is one I admire 
He?s so courageous 
But he?s constantly tired 
Each time when he speaks his mind 
She pats his head and says 
?that?s all very fine 
Exert that will of your own 
When you?re alone 
Now we?d better hurry? 
And with no trace of hesitation 
She keeps going 
Head over heels 
Breaking her way 
Pushing through unknown 
Jungles every day 
She?s a girl 
With a taste for the world 
(the world is like a playing-ground 
Where she goes rushing) 
Head over heels 
Setting the pace 
Running the gauntlet 
In a whirl of lace 
She?s extreme 
If you know what I mean 
You hear her voice everywhere 
Taking the chair 
She?s a leading lady 
And with no trace of hesitation 
She keeps going 
Head over heels 
Breaking her way 
Pushing through unknown 
Jungles every day 
She?s a girl 
With a taste for the world 
(the world is like a playing-ground 
Where she goes rushing) 
Head over heels 
Setting the pace 
Running the gauntlet 
In a whirl of lace 
She?s extreme 
If you know what I mean 
(I think she?s one of those who always 
Likes to do whatever she feels) 
And she goes 
Head over heels
