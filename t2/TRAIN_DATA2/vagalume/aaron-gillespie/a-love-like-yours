Verse 1
I don't know why I can't stop singing
You put the air in my lungs
It's as simple as that, it's just like breathing
Jesus, Your name must be sung
Chorus
I could search the whole world wide
I could search the whole world wide
& never find a love like Yours
And never find a love like Yours
I could search the whole world wide
I could search the whole world wide
& never find a love like Yours
And never find a love like Yours
Never find a love like Yours
Verse 2
I don't know why I can't stop singing
You make my heart overflow
Your perfect love has no boundaries
There's not a depth that you won't go
Chorus
Bridge
There is no one else for me
Oh, none but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring You praise
(repeat)
Chorus
(repeat)
