Fire as far as the eye can see 
widespread consume like an ancient disease 
reaching for something to grab hold 
there's nothing 
suffer the masses buried alive 
stranded taught to struggle but left to die 
dreaming of something to hold faith in 
there's nothing 
the bag with the most wind 
usually has the least to say 
staged crusade while millions suffer 
throw your empty prayer into the dust 
purchase your ticket to salvation 
the real danger is you.
