They can't cease the motion we protect 
the weill outweights amounts everyday 
we stand trial for crimes of firm belief 
and strength beyond what they can comprehend 
you can't crush the movement 
no matter how many bend 
cause you won't bend me 
we can't wash this stain but once tide turns 
the will outlasts amounts everyday 
you can never sway what I represent 
even as existance fades 
in eternal defense of this cause for concern 
even as the pulse melts away 
you can never break this motion.
