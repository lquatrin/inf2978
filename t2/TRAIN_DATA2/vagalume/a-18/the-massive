Check the horizon 
fixate and watch the skies for a sign 
this is disaster then fold for the tenth time 
adhere to foundation 
as the dying menstruate, dry and set 
arise a new bitter moon for the tenth time 
amass the courageous 
the clock has stopped now sleepers awake 
ascend and crush pity for the tenth time 
suffer the feeble 
only misery left in the wake 
this is the end rewriting the tenth sign 
for the tenth time.
