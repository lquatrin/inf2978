Another broken vow set against another broken vow 
your promises hold no water here 
another hopeless tone pacifies another heartless home 
your love is just smoke and mirrors 
on behalf without a voice 
I confront 
in the stance of innocence 
I confront 
another empty space occupies another crowded face 
you couldn't see me if you tried 
another sick react so fucking sick infact 
the thought of faith just leaves me pale 
weight of distress rides squarely on your heart 
mid-shoulder and back 
you've got too much to lose but nothing to live for 
put a rope around your neck to pick up the slack 
draw a blank 
I don't know what you're looking at but you don't see me 
it's clear one look into your eyes tells me you're guilty 
wake this slumber burn out my eyes to be able to sleep 
forty-eight fucking hours awake on misery street 
call your soldier march of the damned or parade of fools 
this is where I live.
