Dead flowers for a dead heart 
I love you more when you've got nothing left to lose 
black dress for a black soul 
you love me back because you've got nothing better to do 
remedy for a sick life 
push the needle vein deep until the venom forces out a smile 
cold hand upon a cold face 
you're so glamorous and I'm glad you never said goobye 
fooled by your smile 
but I don't buy your lie 
wear words in the worst way 
every sound you release is a testament of deceit 
rotate and refuse truth 
circumnavigate and the cycle is now complete 
a cracked mirror for a closed eye 
I wish you luck trying to see what will never be 
shattered wrist holds a broken dream 
you bear fruitless of any hope of trying to reach me 
dream a little dream 
but not of me 
sleep tight 
prepare yourself for the next big collapse 
blanket in the fragile 
put you out of your misery 
I'd thought you'd never ask 
condone disgust as you seal your fate 
darkness forever just as much in a day.
