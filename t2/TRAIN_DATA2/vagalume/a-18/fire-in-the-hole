Pull the pin, hand grenage, hunger 
detonate, blow holes in your summer 
now it's gray and red all year 
with you blood against the clouds 
dip you in arsenic and let you squirm 
on the sill of emptyness 
is this less effective than just 
telling you to go away 
and I never forget 
you're the target 
now this is just a warning 
but I strongly suggest 
you get your fucking head down 
and grab a hold of something 
duck and cover 
or dead and gone? 
kiss your ass goodbye 
fire in the hole 
you should see the look on your face 
it's priceless 
I hit the fuse with a flame and a smile 
blow you away.
