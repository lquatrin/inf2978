It seems a waste to walk your life in reverse
still we do it everyday
choose a lesson and learn it well
before you pass the limit line of change
and now the call to turn this division around
the days of judging are well behind us
have you yet learned wrong from right
you've got the right to flush
your life down the drain
but I won't watch you die.
