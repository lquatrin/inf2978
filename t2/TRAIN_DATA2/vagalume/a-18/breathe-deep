Walk with fools put your trust in the heartless 
become a drowning man 
sink deeper show me what you're made of 
bound and gagged 
don't hold your breath this is my advice to you 
just fall wait in vain for arrival of rescue 
stay weak, you can't fight the sickness boy 
you're destroyed 
to put your trust in a march with the blind 
is to parade without sight too 
just punch yourself in the face 'cause it's easier 
than a lifetime as a fool 
and I'm the one who stands above with the salt 
as soon as the pain rips the skin 
so hold real still while I administer a well 
deserved vaccination 
twist your voice, put the verve into motion 
but the defense is thin 
like combat another balancing act 
your end begins don't hold your breath 
suffocation just a blink away 
always the victim the weak will play..so..
