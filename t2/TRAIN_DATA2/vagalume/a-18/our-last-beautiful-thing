Jagged words direct at me 
deny this heart a chance to beat 
compassion dead like life in your eyes 
why view the mirror when the reflection lies 
emotions tear, views disagree 
for our victim here is all I plea 
don't forget our last beautiful thing 
distracted views far from level sight 
when blame comes time stretch your denial 
refuse the weight at any cost 
concerning what's between us all is lost 
to be understood is to understand 
to love is as to be loved 
to sever the burning hate from our hand 
love of the son, love of the son 
treasure our last beautiful thing.
