You have no self control you have no self respect
you have no tolerance for pain and you've lost
your will to fight
you have no conviction, no condition
you have no code and no honor
and I consider you a disgrace
this is the eulogy that no one will hear
nothing left to hold dear
this is the wake no one will attend
all my heroes are dead
you got your own rules now and your new friends now
claim your thinking for yourself
it's an excuse for your lack of strength
call the movement a joke, the foundation a fraud
but when your world turns to weak
we will still be here standing strong.
in these days of disgrace.
