Sleeping giants wake to clean a dirty slate 
only few stood true in pasts muddy wake 
welcome the new days each brighter than the next 
old true and new weed through 
and rebuild what is left 
welcome the new days 
the key we hold is one keep convictions true 
stand not for loose words temptations far and few 
welcome the new days
