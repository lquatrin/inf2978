I got a plan to escape 
follow me if you want to live 
we can move in the shadows and be unseen 
but I need to know right now if you’re in 
just blink two times if you’re with me 
but don’t make a fucking sound 
this is danger squared, and yes I’m scared 
so hit the deck when I say get down 
we may not make it too far 
in fact, we may be dead by dawn 
but nothing ventured is nothing gained 
so grab what you can carry and let’s get gone 
just nod once if you’re ready 
and let’s bolt when the coast is clear 
no matter the price, the worth of my life 
but i gotta get the fuck out of here 
when it comes to disaster I've got the plan 
drive and the means blueprint in hand 
weapon of choice these wings expand 
goddamn 
hit the ground running when we pass the line 
if we get separated double back behind 
if we meet resistance prepare to fight 
we didn't come this far to give up 
let’s move it 
boot up!
