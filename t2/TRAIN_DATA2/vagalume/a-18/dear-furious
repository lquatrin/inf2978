Baptised in fire and brimstone 
nothing but ash as I call this purity home 
blown, kingdom come and back 
stand among the edge to avoid the impact 
shovel in your shit and drone 
spit heavy-handed off another broken backbone 
and clone designed for distress 
I consider myself blessed 
driven as I roll on by 
sticking to the vision like mud in your eye 
but I dont blur like vast expanse 
and trip all over your false sense of perseverance 
dear furious 
what the mirror shines back as I reflect and counter attack 
words confuse like mind rot 
metaphoric onslaught will not stop 
and all this is tearing you apart 
(WE WILL NOT STOP) 
in pieces now how you lie(broken) 
I'll receive wings spread open wide(broken) 
of weakness you are born dead(broken) 
into to falling hands broken but blessed(broken) 
go for the throat and cleanse 
purge yourself of this 
drain and sift for a cause 
and a glimpse of purpose 
drag your entrails through knives 
reverse and sterilize 
heave and gag on disgust deceive 
and damn your eyes.
