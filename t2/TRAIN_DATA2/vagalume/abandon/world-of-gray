Am I all alone.
Will we ever break these molds of stone?
Are you even there?
I'm not here for you to try to compare.
Now I want to know!! 
Am I lost inside...Your world of grey?
No hope, there is no light...
to make it through another day.
Forever and always are the words you say.
But, I can't take no more.
Inside you'll stay...
In your world of grey. 
Winters almost here.
Seasons change but your no longer here.
Are you all alone?
Hows it feel when your the only stone?
Now I want to know!! 
Am I lost inside...Your world of grey?
No hope, there is no light...
to make it through another day.
Forever and always are the words you say.
But, I can't take no more.
Inside you'll stay...
Solo 
Am I lost inside...Your world of grey?
No hope, there is no light...
to make it through another day.
Forever and always ae the words you say.
But, I can't take no more.
Inside you'll stay...
In your world of grey.
