Falling into Darkness, I can't see.
Reaching for the enlightment there will be.
All these excuses I have made.
No more will I say them, I am saved.
You have awakened the spirit in me.
Walking in shadows I have...
Seen the world thats meant to be.
Standing here I can see you look at me.
Hoping that I will leave you be.
Are you afraid to see the truth?
Do you believe he's inside of you?
He has awakened the spirit in me.
Walking in shadows I have...
Seen the world he has for me.
I can see it in your eyes.
Your afraid to comprimise.
He's not here to take from you.
He can see inside of you.
Let him in. 
Solo

He can see the real you.
Let him in...
Let him in.
