Looking at the wall
I see a need for peace
I want to change the course of history
I see the heavy souls
Praying for it lives
The song for the broken we will sing
There’s a light shining brighter than the sun
There’s a love that can’t be broken
Heaven is coming down, coming down
A movement in your veins
And a pathetic face
We try to recreate a beautiful escape
We try the "answers" weak
And a epidemic going repeat
Love holds the cure for all humanity
yeahh
There’s a light shining brighter than the sun
There’s a love that can’t be broken
A Savior giving hope to the world
Heaven is coming down, coming down
Blessed are the weak when they down on their knees
Heaven is singing, heaven is singing
Blessed are the weak when they down on their knees
Heaven is singing, heaven is singing
The song for the broken
Uh uh uh uh Yeah!
