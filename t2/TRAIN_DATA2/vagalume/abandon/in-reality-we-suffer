Darkness surrounds us soon will descend
Grey decay living dead dark are the days ahead
Conserve that precious hatred for later
Dark are the days ahead the walls we face are growing heavy to carry its name
Carved in flesh the rage
If this is it let the apocalypse begin
Grey decay living dead
Dark are the days ahead a thousand destinies made one and nothing
If this is it let the apocalypse begin
So alike so alone we suffer
