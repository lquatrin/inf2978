Verse 1
My "stumble" mind says
I don't really need You
Self-reliance controls me
From the inside
But I cannot hold myself a bit anymore
So this is my sweet confession
Chorus
This tears on my demand
I cannot scares
There's nothing to defend anyway [No]
'Cause this is the song You wrote for me
Can You ever sing it?
Can You ever sing it?
Verse 2
I surrender to the fall
Found me in the sorrow
Cuz I've reach the end now
Help me see tomorrow
Give me one more sunrise
Verse 3
I won't be forgotten
Will You remember me?
I don't I want to wonder
Will You come after me?
I don't wanna be a prisoner
Would You can set me free? [Free]
