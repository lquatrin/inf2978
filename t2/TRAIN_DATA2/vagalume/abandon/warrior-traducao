Lets take this giant down
Cause my heart is like, like a warrior
No one can stop us now
We were born to rise, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, a warrior
I'm done with hot in here
On the sidelines controlled by my fear
Cause now I relize
That my faith comes from more than my eyes
We're caught in the middle
Of a fight we can't ignore
Let go of you're armor
Cause insides a warrior
Lets take this giant down
Cause my heart is like, like a warrior
No one can stop us now
We were born to rise like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, a warrior
Push back all the battlelines
Even in our mines
Cause you know that this is the time
We're strong because of love
More than conquerers
Cause the battle is already won
We're caught in the middle
Of a fight we can't ignore
Let go of you're armor
Cause insides a warrior
Lets take this giant down
Cause my heart is like, like a warrior
No one can stop us now
We were born to rise, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, a warrior
ooh
It's faith that makes us strong
The battles already won
You're love you're will be done
The battles already won
It's already won
Lets take this giant down
Cause my heart is like, like a warrior
No one can stop us now
We were born to rise, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, like a warrior
We are, we are, we are
Like a warrior, a warrior
