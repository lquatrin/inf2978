The angels stood in awe at the sight they saw
The night you were betrayed
You could have saved yourself
But you held back the Heavens
and let them carry you away
You laid your kingdom down they handed you a crown
Of thorns you were torn but cried
let your will be done
It wasn? t nails that held
You to the cross
It was love, it was love
it was Your love
You took our place carried our guilt and shame
All for us, all for us
all for us
It wasn? t nails that held You, it was love
To think you chose this cup knowing
all that was to come
Oh the grace
that poured from you
Before Your final breathe through
Your tears you said
Forgive them for they know not what they do
You looked up to the sky
let out a final cry
It is done, hope has won
Lord let Your kingdom come
