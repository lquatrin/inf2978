Where have you been hiding so long
Is it me, or have you gone away
Is it fear that keeps me thinking
You never hear the words I say
Though you live so far away
I still believe in You
Fall on me, again, wherever I go
You always find a way
Your hands I want to hold me
I will never look away again
Speak to You from the deepest part of me
Jesus, this time I need You
Fall on me, again, wherever I go
You always find a way to
Fall on me, again, wherever I go
You always find a way to me
I need You, I need You
Fall on me
I need to feel Your arms
Wrapped around my heart
Fall on me
I need to feel Your love
Pouring over me
Fall on me, again, wherever I go
You always find a way to
Fall on me, again, wherever I go
You always find a way to me
Over and over, again
I still need You
Over and over, again
I still need You
Over and over, again
I still need You
Over and over, again
I still need You
Over and over, again
I still need You
I still need You
I still need You
Oh, oh, yeah
Keep me walking with You
I need You
Keep me hanging on to You
Yeah, ah, ah, ah
Over and over, again
I still need You, oh
Over and over, again
I still need You
