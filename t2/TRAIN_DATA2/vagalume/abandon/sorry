I see the way you look at me.
Silently asking me to set you free.
Am I too late? Have you gone your way?
Breath your secrets to me so you'll stay.
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
Sorry I wanted everything.
Are we trying to be seen?
Sorry i've fallen short of you.
I'm here despite the things you do.
Inside your head I hear your plea's.
I can't give you what you want to be.
Is there someone else that's on your side?
I can't tell so I will just decide.
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
Sorry I wanted everything.
Are we trying to be seen?
Sorry i've fallen short of you.
I'm here despite the things you do.
Solo
Get up, get up, get up...let's go... 
I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying...I'm dying inside. 
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
"screamed"
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
I'm dying to know all these things deep in you.
Your making me crazy, What more can I do?
End.
