(Hey! hey!)
(Hey! hey!)
A man stands alone, arms across his chest
His heart pounding through his bones
Denial wasn't suppose to be this way
His passion feel to the ground
But beauty couldn't be found
Another way
Another way
Well only his answer would tell the story
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
But denial seemed so beautiful
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
But providence took it's hold
(Hey! hey!)
Tears drowns his eyes
A puddle a shame at his feet
As the reflection
Of guilt overwhelms a broken man
Dissents was all he had
And he needed a reason to believe
This doesn't happen
To only me
Well only his answer would tell the story
(Wake up and see we're all the same)
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
But denial seemed so beautiful
(Seemed so beautiful)
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
But providence took it's hold
Eletric pulse you can't escape
A force that rules the human race
Hold the hand of providence
Tonight the star
Tell no fortunes
They tell no fortunes
They tell no fortunes
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
But denial seemed so beautiful
(Seemed so beautiful)
Three times
Were all he had to say yes
(say yes)
Say yeah yeah yeah
Oh but providence took it's hold
(Took took took it's hold)
Three times
Three times
Three times
