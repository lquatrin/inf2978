Verse 1
I ask myself what can I offer You
Can You use someone who already feels used ?
Have all my mistakes laid You down
Can You turn my failures around
Chorus
Here we are now
In this moment, here we are
You are my hope when I'm broken
I am at the end of myself
Here we are
This is the start of a new life
Like a child
Breathing this air for the first time
I am made new, I am made new
Verse 2
Create in me a heart as pure as gold
The beauty of Your love within my soul
You've never felt so near
And the view has never been so clear
Chorus
Here we are now
In this moment, here we are
You are my hope when I'm broken
I am at the end of myself
Here we are
This is the start of a new life
Like a child
breathing this air for the first time
I am made new, in you, in you
I am made new, in you, in you
