Oh, say goodbye, to the way
Things were before
Oh, this is the way it goes
A life where everyday feels like a miracle
I want to open up my heart to you
I want to stare at the stars with you
I want to say that I love you
Over a million times
Oh, I can see you soul
Looking into you and your so beautiful
Oh, we have come a long way
I want you to know everything's ok
Walking on the waves that
Crashed down over you and me
You're the reason I believe
In love at all
Through all the things that we
Have come, I know our love is
Getting strong, I'm wanting you
To know that I believe in you
I want to open up my heart to you
I want to stare at the stars
