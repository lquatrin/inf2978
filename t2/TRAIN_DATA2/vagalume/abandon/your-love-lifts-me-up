Patiently I wait
and all I can say
I need so much more of You (You)
In Your light I’ll stay
and now want You to draw me
Into Your arms full of love
Take me where I can go alone
Gibingly sight what in needs
I want life from You in me
Jesus Your love lifts me up
You’re all that I’ve been searching for
And everything I have is Yours
Jesus Your love lifts me up
I wait here for You
To speak words that give new life to me
I know I could never have too much
When I am in desperate place
You give light to my escape
And carry me when I am weak
Oh Lord It’s You I seek
Hold me close
when I fall down
I’m crying out without a sound
Hold me close
when I fall down
I’m crying out
save me now
