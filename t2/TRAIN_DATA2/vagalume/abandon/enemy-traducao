We all need to follow something to understand
We're looking around us for stable ground to stand
Scars of compassion digging me deep inside
No one around me, I've got no place to hide
You can't escape it
That's why you feel it
You can't escape it
I want to be your enemy
But I can't, because you mean to much to me
All this time you’ve been fakin’
All awhile my hearts been breakin
Can’t you see that I want to be your Enemy?
secured by my demons when it was you who paid
All of these reasons I can no longer say
Don't you see clear now, I just can't be this man
Too many feelings, too hard to understand
You can't escape it
That's why you feel it
You can't escape it
I want to be your enemy
But I can't, because you mean to much to me
All this time you’ve been fakin’
All awhile my hearts been breakin
Can’t you see that I want to be your Enemy
Solo
I want to be your enemy
But I can't, because you mean to much to me
All this time you’ve been fakin’
All awhile my hearts been breakin
Can’t you see that I want to be your Enemy
End
