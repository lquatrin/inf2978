Spoken:
"Take a look inside of yourself".
"The Pity, self gratification".
"It's a walk in the park next to my life".
Many years ago they walked the other way.
No one wanted you, there's nothing left to say.
Tell yourself the lies, you know it's all untrue.
Time to show the world this thing they've made of you.
You x4 
I don't need your system.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
Casting stones at my head.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
I will rise up stronger.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
Why we piss and moan to people we betray?
Leaves me thinking there has got to be a way.
Seeing doubt in my mind isn't a part of me.
Soon we'll rest, then we all shall see.
I don't need your system.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
Casting stones at my head.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
I will rise up stronger.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
You. 
Solo 
I don't need your system.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
Casting stones at my head.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
I will rise up stronger.
I can see through all that you do.
I can see through all of you.
I can see it. Can you?
