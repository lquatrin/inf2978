[verse 1]
You can run but I’ll be here waiting
For your return when you get frustrated
I’m the only one who loves you without condition
Here I am
[chorus 1]
I will, I will be here
Waiting, waiting
I will, I will be still
I’ll never change my mind
[verse 2]
I’m a rock and you can stand on me
Whenever you’re lost I’m the road that you need to take
This world is crazy and it’s not the safest place to be
Oh, come with me!
[chorus 2]
I will, I will be here
Waiting, waiting
I will, I will be still
I’ll never change now
I will, I will be here
Waiting, waiting
I will, I will be still
I never tell a lie
Come with me
[verse 3]
You can run, but I’ll be here waiting
For your return when you get so frustrated
I’m right here
