He walked the dirty streets. Famous for nothing.
He said "come follow me" and they came.
A face like all the rest.
But something was different.
The Son of God would lead the way.
And soon they all would say.
There He goes - a hero. A savior to the world.
Here He stands with scars in His hands.
With love He gave His life so we could be free.
The Savior of the world.
He spoke with clarity. Walked across the sea.
A single word would calm the storm.
His touch could heal the sick, but He was called a hypocrite.
Laid behind the stone. His death was shortly mourned. He left the curtain torn.
There He goes - a hero. A savior to the world.
Here He stands with scars in His hands.
With love he gave His life so we could be free.
The Savior of the world.
He choose to take the cross. Shed tears for the lost, the broken, and the needy.
Forgiving those who were and will be.
The angel made it clear. He told them have no fear.
He's not here. He's not here!
There He goes - The Hero. The Savior to the world.
Here He stands with scars in His hands.
With love He gave his life so we could be free.
The Savior of the world. The Savior of the world. The Savior of the world.
