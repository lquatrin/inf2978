Do you feel like you're alone
Has this life left you broken
And you're searching for a way to cope
With this hurt that you're holding
Well there's a god who knows your pain
And he has the scars to prove it
So everybody keep the faith cause soon there'll be a day
When all the skies
Will break and all of us will see
His face his face
All creation will awake and over all the earth
His love will reign
Forever, forever
Let hope now feel your heart let all the lies be broken
Cause your finding who you really are here in the light of heaven
When all the skies
Will break and all of us will see
His face his face
All creation will awake and over all the earth
His love will reign
Forever, forever
So keep watching let your hope arise
Heaven is coming everybody lift your eyes
Everybody lift your eyes
Do you feel like you're alone
When all the skies
Will break and all of us will see
His face his face
All creation will awake and over all the earth
His love will reign
Forever, forever
