I feel her staring from the shadows
Why is this place where I want to be?
She knows me well enough to break me
Cast her spell and soon she sets me free
I can handle these emotions
Gotta take my time
I can't handle these emotions
Gonna take my time
I don't want to be another savior
That just can't be
Are you so blind? I just cannot be yours
So why do you keep haunting me?
Are you a trace of imagination?
Why do you feel so close to me?
I've told you, I'm already taken
Is this a test to see who I will be?
I can handle these emotions
Gotta take my time
I can't handle these emotions
Gonna take my time
I don't want to be another savior
That just can't be
Are you so blind? I just cannot be yours
So why do you keep haunting me?
Break down
I can handle these emotions
Gotta take my time
I can't handle these emotions
Gonna take my time
I don't want to be another savior
That just can't be
Are you so blind? I just cannot be yours
So why do you keep haunting me?
I don't want to be another savior
That just can't be
Are you so blind? I just cannot be yours
So why do you keep haunting me?
