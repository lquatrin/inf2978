I’m in a dangerous place
No direction within
I feel lost in myself
Trapped in my skin
It's a critical state
In my mind I can tell
That the future it’s temp
If I don't get some help
I am lost without You
Safe in Your arms
When I'm weak
You carried me
I am safe in Your arms
You're my strength
You're my safety
Oh looking back
Coming years
All the blind, swept and tears
They were times
We've saw
When I fell apart
You're the light at the end
Of the road You're a friend
When I want to give up
You keeps Your love
I know I've been lost without You
Safe in Your arms
When I'm weak
You carried me
I am safe in Your arms
You're my strength
You're my safety
With You I never walk alone
I know I know
Where I belong
With You I never walk alone
'Cause You carry me
Safe in Your arms
When I'm weak
You carried me
I am safe in Your arms
You're my strength
You're my safety
