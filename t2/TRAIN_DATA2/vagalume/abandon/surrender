[Verse 1]
Bring to life my fading dreams
Pave the road that leads to change
Clear my conscience tonight
Fill the void inside of me
Heal these eyes so I can see
I want it to be you
[Chorus]
Before tonight is over
Say goodbye forever
Give my life to you
(My old ways are no good)
Before my dreams are shattered
And I can't remember
My way back to you
Give it all to you
[Verse 2]
Yesterday when I was
Sinking down and almost gone
Your lifeboat rescued me
I was weak and fading fast
But you then gave me hope to last
I know that it was you
[Bridge]
The surrender I felt
When I gave you my heart
Left me standing praying for the rain
[Final]
Before tonight is over
Before my dreams are shattered
I'll bring it back (to me)
Back... (to you)
Back... (to me)
To you!
