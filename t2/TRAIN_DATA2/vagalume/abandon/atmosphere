[verse 1]
I’m captured by the love
And I have become Your own
Surrounded by my God
I’m rising above the shadows
[pre-chorus]
You want me to know
I’m not alone
You want me to come
To Your throne, I know...
[chorus 1]
It’s in Your atmosphere
Your spirit is here
I can’t explain this moment
In Your atmosphere
[verse 2]
You’re raining over me
Flooding my soul with peace
In sin You show mercy
My gracious King
[chorus 2]
It’s in Your atmosphere
Your spirit is here
I can’t explain this moment
In Your atmosphere
Your love becomes real
My heart begins to sink
Into Your hands
[bridge]
I’ll come and hear You say
You’re precious to me
I’ll come and hear You say
You’re precious to me
I’ll come and hear You say
You’re precious to me
I’ll come and hear You speak...
[final]
It’s in Your atmosphere
It’s in Your atmosphere
It’s in Your atmosphere I come
I'm coming in Your atmosphere
It’s in Your atmosphere
It’s in Your atmosphere I come
To hear you speak
I come to hear you speak
I come to hear you speak
