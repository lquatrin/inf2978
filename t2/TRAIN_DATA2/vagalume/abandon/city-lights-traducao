This city lights burns up right
but inside there is a darkness
Oh I do I feel hopeless
The whole world in my sides
But I’m still reaching
For something in the distance
Wasn’t you that disappear
Or did I turn away
Am I the one to blame?
For my own heartache
We used to be so close
But we’ve times we drifted apart
Now I’m on my way down the road
To where You are
To find your heart
It’s like the hallway never end
This road is getting narrowing
I travel to the mountains
Through their sunset
Wasn’t you that disappear
Or did I turn away
Am I the one to blame?
For my own mistakes
We used to be so close
But we’ve times we drifted apart
Now I’m on my way down the road
To where You are
To find your heart
This is where I want to be
This is where You’re calling me
To travel down this road [this narrow road]
Straight and narrow
This is straight and narrow [Straight and narrow]
This is where I want to be
This is where You’re calling me
Oh, straight and narrow
We used to be close
We used to be so close
But we’ve times we drifted apart
Now I’m on my way down the road
To where You are
To find your heart
We used to be so close
But we’ve ‘drifted’ apart
I’m find in You
On this road, on this road
[this narrow road, this narrow road…]
This is where I want to be
