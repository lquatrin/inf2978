Right now
I see…
I see…
I see with imagination
Everyone around here knows my name
I'll be…
I'll be…
I'll be the one who you'll want
Everyone around will know my name
Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
I am all your lives
UNREALITY
Empty…
Empty…
Empty and alone we wonder
Though my tattoo's tell this story
theres another way to live
Chrous - Unreality (spoken)
Middle guitar break
Chorus x2
End
