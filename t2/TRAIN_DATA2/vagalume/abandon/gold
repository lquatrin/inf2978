Staring at eyes as cold as icebergs
All of my friends you can count on one him
I’ve never trust my life to a perfect stranger
You carried my cross and became my friend
I’m on the wrong side of the tracks
I want to get back
but there’s a galaxy up yet
I need to find the stars
to get to You
You’re gold
You're like candle light
You’re the sun away in the dawn
In my soul, You are burning bright
With your luminance in glow
You’re gold
I’m coming in the hills for any sign
A sparkler light to catch my eye
we’re standing on top of the world
But the mountains blow into the sky
We’re on the wrong side of the map
We gonna get back
This place is not our home
We're on the rock car racing for you
You’re gold
You're like candle light
You’re the sun away in the dawn
In my soul, You are burning bright
With your luminance in glow
You’re gold
Why am I scared ?
I Wanna breath your air
You’ re the whisper I hear
Carry on the wild
You’re gold
You're like candle light
You’re the sun away in the dawn
In my soul, You are burning bright
With your luminance in glow
You’re gold
