Sometimes when I get lonely,
You don't understand my feelings.
I've got to push you over
so you'll see just what I'm saying.
You've got the best of me.
I'll take the best of you.
No one can tell me that I'm through
with you until it's over.
I want what no one knows.
You're the one, there's no one better.
I want what no one see's.
You're the one, there is no other.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
You're gonna see right through
all the layers of me.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
No time to talk it through.
I'm the one you're after.
I can't just sit and wonder
why you tease me with your hunger.
You can't deny, you're all the same.
I can't complain your here.
Your voice heard only by me.
No one can tell me that I'm through
with you until it's over.
I want what no one knows.
You're the one, there's noone better.
I want what no one see's.
You're the one, there is no other.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
You're gonna see right through
all the layers of me.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
No time to talk it through.
I'm the one you're after.
-Breakdown- 
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
You're gonna see right through
all the layers of me.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
No time to talk it through.
I'm the one you're after.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
You're gonna see right through
all the layers of me.
Reach, I'm gonna reach for you.
No time to talk it through.
Your the one I'm after.
Outro End.
