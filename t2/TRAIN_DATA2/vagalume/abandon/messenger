Love is calling you back to life
so grab the moment and hold on tight
there's a message that you need to hear
that we were never made to live in fear
love is calling you closer
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
Carrying the message of love
Love is calling you back home
I know you feel it but your not alone
Here's the one thing that I know is real
there is not a heart that can't be healed
Love is calling you closer, so come closer
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
Carrying the message of love
It doesn't matter who you are
This is for every broken heart
It doesn't matter who you are
Love is calling you closer
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
I am a messenger
I am a messenger
Carrying the message of love
