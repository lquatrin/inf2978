No more tomorrow, leave it all behind.
You can't understand the way I feel
'Cause you are blind.
Reaching for the answers before the day is done.
I can't make you understand these things that I have done. 
I show my feelings yet you walk away.
Why do you haunt me with these things you say?
Regrets are something I don't care about.
Yet these emotions I still think about...
In Sorrow...
In Sorrow... 
Reaching for companions, we know we can't find.
Makes you feel your worthless like your beaten deep inside.
Dying for acceptance, people choose to lie.
No one really understands your person deep inside.
I show my feelings yet you walk away.
Why do you haunt me with these things you say?
Regrets are something I don't care about.
Yet these emotions I still think about...
In Sorrow...
In Sorrow... 
Solo 
I show my feelings yet you walk away.
Why do you haunt me with these things you say?
Regrets are something I don't care about.
Yet these emotions I still think about...
In Sorrow...
In Sorrow...
