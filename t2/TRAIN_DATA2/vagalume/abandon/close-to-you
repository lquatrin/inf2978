Wake up now, wake up,
I let you get away, I let you get away,
Stand up now, stand up,
I'm moving right away,
I am hearing what you say,
I'm getting close to you,
My heart is ready for you,
Stay awhile, stay awhile,
Now this is something new,
I know I'm ready for you,
Stay awhile, stay awhile,
Lose sight now, I'm losing sight,
Cause all I see is you, all I see is you,
You touch me now I'm whole,
I know just who you are,
When all I feel is you, all I feel is you
All that I am, all that you are,
You've given me what I have so far,
Future is bright, we're out of the dark,
I'm not looking back, now,
I give you my heart,
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile
