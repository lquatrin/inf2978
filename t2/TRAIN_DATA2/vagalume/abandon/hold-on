She sits alone and wonders
When is the end of broken dreams
This isnt what I pictured
She said as tears rolled down her cheeks
She needs a friend beside her
Shes looking for a savior
Hold on Hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on Hold on
Somebody loves you
She grabs her coat to leave
So sure its gonna be the end
Another broken family
Tears are her only friends
This isnt the life they wanted
Shes hoping that heaven comes through
Hold on Hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on Hold on
Somebody loves you
Yeah
Hold on Hold on
Youre not drowning this time
Hold on Hold on
Look for the search lights
Does anybody care
Do you even see
Look past my skin
Do you see me
Do you even know what Im going through
I need to talk to someone
Can I talk to you
Does anybody care
Do you even see
Im running out of hope and sanity
Do you even know what Im going through
Im having a hard time facing the truth
Does anybody care
Does anybody care
Does anybody care
Oh
Hold on Hold on
Someone will find you
Hold on Hold one
Somebody loves you
Hold on Hold on
Youre not drowning this time
Hold on Hold on
Look for the search lights
Hold on Hold on
