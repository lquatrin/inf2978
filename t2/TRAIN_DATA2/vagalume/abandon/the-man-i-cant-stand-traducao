Facing life, These things I've Comprised
Too much to realize how far I've got to go
No more lies, to much to criticize
I've got so much inside, you people got to know
Took my chance and fell for cheap romance
The kind of circumstance thatâ€™s always hard to call
Rectify the feelings lost inside
So I can bring to life the one that made me fall
Why do I walk alone?
I can see you in my dreams
Why can't I find a home?
I can see you in my dreams
Realize who I am
I can see you in my dreams
I'm the man I can't stand
Forgiveness comes after you hurt someone
I've come to know this one, I've got so much to learn
Can't take it back, hope that I'm on the track
to bring us back to where we were before I turned
Why do I walk alone?
I can see you in my dreams
Why can't I find a home?
I can see you in my dreams
Realize who I am
I can see you in my dreams
I'm the man I can't stand
