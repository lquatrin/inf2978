Sleepwalk your way through this dying hell
Strive to keep our heads above the waterline
No hope just a ratwheel of aching days
System changes tide from low to high
Kneel your way through this lying game
If they pass us their backs lie free
Sleepwalk your way through this dying hell
Beaten down by the invincible pain
This life the lives remaining stains
Betrayal seeks the missing piece
Try to line in the hands hopelessness crawl beneath and hide to die
Burden of birth they gave you hell
Like ice shattering under feet
A broken fucked up mind breaks easily like leaves fallen their tree
A dried out soul dies away this year
Crawl beneath and hide to die
Burden of birth they gave you hell
I am falling endlessly
Blackened shattered dead crippled existence
We crawled for crumbs spilled our passion
We washed our tears in dedication
