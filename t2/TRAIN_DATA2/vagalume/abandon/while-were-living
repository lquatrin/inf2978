Her bruises paint the story she's been living
She feels now that
She'll never be forgiven
She'll close her eyes for her escape
And pray to god it's not too late
Cause honestly it's just too much to take
Oh let us love while we're living
Oh is there more than what we're giving
Let us take our love to the least of us
Young and old all around the world
Oh let us love while we're living
Young boy waiting all alone an orphan
Too small to wonder
Why he's forgotten
He'll close his eyes and fall asleep not knowing
Where tomorrow leads
And honestly we all have what he needs
Oh let us love while we're living
Oh is there more than what we're giving
Let us take our love to the least of us
Young and old all around the world
Oh let us love while we're living
All around the world
We can take this love
We can take this love
Your stories will be heard
We can take this love
We can take this love
