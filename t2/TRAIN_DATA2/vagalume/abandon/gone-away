I can look in your eyes.
It's good to see you once again my friend. 
Are you still in my life?
It's hard to feel you here with me.
Can you see?
Looking back at our lives
I can't imagine it without you.
That's the truth.
Gone Away.
Gone Away.
Did you hear me say goodbye?
No one can take that from me.
Gone Away.
And now your here with me.
Somewhere deep down inside
living inside me, there is you.
I know it's you.
Did you know who all came?
Did you hear them say your name?
All the same.
I can no longer stay
holding onto what became of you.
What to do?
Gone Away.
Gone Away.
Did you hear me say goodbye?
No one can take that from me.
Gone Away.
And now your here with me.
Solo 
Spoken/breakdown 
Gone Away.
Gone Away.
Did you hear me say goodbye?
Noone can take that from me.
Gone Away.
And now your here with me.
I can look in your eyes.
It's good to see you once again my friend. 
End.
