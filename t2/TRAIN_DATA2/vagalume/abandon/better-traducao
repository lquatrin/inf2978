My heart knows you are
you're constantly right here
always near, always near
but in my head it gets hard to let go of the wheel
that got me here and let you steer
I've crashed so many times
to know it's true that I'm
I'm better when I'm with you
Time has shown on my own
I won't make it very far all alone
I'm not alone
And at my best I'm still a mess
Just a man who needs to let you take control, take control
I've crashed so many times
to know it's true that I'm
I'm better when I'm with you
You bring the best out in me
You bring the best out in me
In me
