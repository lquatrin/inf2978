We make the music loud
To drown our broken lives
In the noises
This world is going down
And there's no hope in sight
When the blind lead the blind
All we see are blue skies
God must have blue eyes
And He is watching over me
Our whole world is waiting
Withered and fading
And rescue's only a prayer away
If I could write a song
That would save the world
I would sing it
I would sing it tonight
If I could say a prayer
That would free your soul
I would say it
I would pray it tonight
Is there a cure for our condition?
Or are we under a new addiction?
Our history's forgotten
How fragile we are
All we need are the blue skies
We find them in Your eyes
You give hope to withered soul
We hold de lyrics
Color and promise
This words will reckon save us all
If I could write a song
That would save the world
I would sing it
I would sing it tonight
If I could say a prayer
That would free your soul
I would say it
I would pray it tonight
Tonight
We are waiting
We are waiting
We are waiting
And rescue is only a prayer away
These words will save us all
Tonight we're praying
