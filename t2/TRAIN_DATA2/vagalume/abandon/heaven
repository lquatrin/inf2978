Looking up at the stars trying to connect the dots
What are we here for
Spinning out of control
When it stops we'll never know just trying to hold on
Sometimes there is no easy answer
Sometimes you gotta take a chance
Close your eyes and listen to the music and just start to dance
Start to
Live
Like we wanna live forever
Love
Like we wanna touch the sky
Change the world and make it better
Heaven starts here with you and I
Oh it's you and I
Not just a see of faces but tidal waves of changes
We are so much more
We're roaring through the ages
A sound that's so contagious and we'll never stop no, no
Sometimes you see the way so clearly
Sometimes it falls right in your hands
So just start moving to the rhythm
Cause it's time to dance, it's time to
Live
Like we wanna live forever
Love
Like we wanna touch the sky
Change the world and make it better
Heaven starts here with you and I
We'll stand together
One heart forever
And we will never
Be the same
