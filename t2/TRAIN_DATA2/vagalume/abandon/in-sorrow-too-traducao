I’m, Feeling so alone
My heart feels like stone
What more is there?
Tell me I don’t know the answer
Why, do I always lie?
Others can’t deny
Blinking of an eye
We’ve lost the only good thing
Inside my mind I wonder alone
And I cry for someone to hold
Still your eye’s are cold and glassy blue
Now I’m in sorrow too!
See, what you’ve done to me
I can hardly see
Cover me with
Your black cloud of love and hatred
Inside my mind I wonder alone
And I cry for someone to hold
Still your eye’s are cold and glassy blue
Now I’m in sorrow too!
Solo
Inside my mind I wonder alone
And I cry for someone to hold
Still your eye’s are cold and glassy blue
Now I’m in sorrow too!
Inside my mind I wonder alone
And I cry for someone to hold
Still your eye’s are cold and glassy blue
Now I’m in sorrow too!
End
