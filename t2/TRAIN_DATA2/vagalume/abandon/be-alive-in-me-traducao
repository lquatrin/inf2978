[verse 1]
Here I am without a place to start
Lost inside the desert of my heart
All of my mistakes are adding up
Take them all away I’ve had enough
[pre-chorus]
Heal my jaded soul
I want to feel the weight letting go
[chorus]
Be alive in me
I know, I’m Yours forever
Be alive in me
I know, I’m Yours
So take me and shake me
I know I’m needing You to
Be alive in me, I’m Yours
[verse 2]
I need You here so we can talk it out
I’m giving You the things that pull me down
Jesus, can You teach me how to stand?
And if I fall I want to fall into Your hands
[bridge]
Excite me, ignite me
Relight this fire
Excite me, ignite me
Relight this fire
