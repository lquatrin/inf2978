We are the light of the
We are the light of the world
So let it shine out and let it shine out
And show who we are
Right now let it out so they all can hear the sound
Our voice make it loud c'mon now just shout it out
We are the light of the we are the light of the world
Let's take this love like rock n' roll let it move
Our feet our heart and soul
Tell me that you feel it
Tell me that you hear the sound
The sound of love
There's a fire in us there's a fire and it's rising
Burn it brighter make it higher taking on the night
Right now let it out so they all can see it shine
Our flame let it burn c'mon now this is the time
There's a fire in us there's a fire in us, let it rise
Let's take this love like rock n' roll let it move
Our feet our heart and soul
Tell me that you feel it
Tell me that you hear the sound
Take this love like a firework
Let's burn this night until we see the sun
Tell me that you feel it tell me that you hear the sound
The sound of love
