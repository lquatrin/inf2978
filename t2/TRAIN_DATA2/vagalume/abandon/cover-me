I'm looking for You again,
All I need is for You to be near,
I am so lost without You,
I cannot live without You here,
I need You, in my life,
Reach out for me,
I want You, in my life, more of You,
Cover me, with You,
I need to feel Your love all
Over me, I know,
You will be the one,
So walk with me tonight,
All I want is for You
To overtake my life,
Moving through me once more,
Come in my heart, again and again,
I need You, in my life,
Reach out for me,
I want You, in my life, more of You,
Breath in me, more of You,
And make me, more like You,
I need You, I need You,
Help me find You,
To cover me, yeah,
Yeah, oh
