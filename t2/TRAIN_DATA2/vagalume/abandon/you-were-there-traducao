Staring into darkness
where shadows disappear
this place I am is lonely as I wait for you here
Cause I'm struggling to find a hope in the middle of my fear
Can you calm my restless soul
and the storm that's drawing near
You were there when the waves surrounded me
You were there for the mountains I could not reach
When the weight of the world tried to bring me to my knees
You were there
I try to find the answers why am I still here
how does trouble always find me
Why is life unfair
but I know you're always listening to the beating of my heart
Now I want to hear you whispering so I know that you're not far
You were there when the waves surrounded me
You were there for the mountains I could not reach
When the weight of the world tried to bring me to my knees
You were there
I won't walk alone through the darkest night
I won't stand on my own though the flames ignite
when the waters rise your arms are holding me tight
you were there
