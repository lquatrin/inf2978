You sit there in the waiting room
Anxious for the news
You've been to everyone you could
But their playing the same tune
But in the darkness there's a light
So rest your weary eyes
And lift your head up high
Your hope is alive
Your hope is alive
I see it in your eyes
Your hope is alive
This prison that you made
You got the feeling that you can't escape
There's a fire that can't be contained
That can burn all your chains away
When the storm is raging there's a peace
A voice that calms the seas
A reason to believe
When everything is crashing down
When your fortress crumbles to the ground
And your strength is failing now
But in the darkness there's a light so rest your weary eyes
And lift your head up high
Our hope is alive
Our hope is alive
I see it in your eyes
Our hope is alive
