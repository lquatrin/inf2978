Behind the red door, in american skin
There is a murder of roses
In the midnight hiss, come cover me there
For I am electric nothing
Out on the tide, strangers all
Are drowning by
Under eclipse, I wait for your kiss
With the beating of all
These idiot hearts
And no more evil now, no horror sound
No maniac song from tyrant
And the surfer king will show me everything
In the great, green flash of the evening
Out on the tide, strangers we ride
Smoke in our eyes
Under eclipse, I wait for your kiss
With the beating of all
These idiot hearts
