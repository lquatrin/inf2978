There's a twisting in your senses
There's a river in your blood
And the crows land on the fences
There's a daughter in the flood
Can you see?

Leavin' with ease on the darkest breeze
Tonight's the night
And come to me sweet and slow my dear
Tonight's the night
And the moon is just a sliver
Hear the rushing make it sound
And you wish to be delivered
Oh, to be no longer bound
Can you see?
Do you know?
Leavin' with ease on the darkest breeze
Tonight's the night
And come to me sweet and slow my dear
Tonight's the night
It's all in your head, 'least that's what you said
Tonight's the night
Sing to me sweet and slow
Tonight
