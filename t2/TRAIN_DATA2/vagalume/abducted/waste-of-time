all you ever do is waste my time 
  well i don't wanna hear you f*cking wine 
  you must think i give a sh*t about you 
  why don't you come on and see if i do 
  but you can't understand why 
  no i don't like you so don't waste my time 
  i'm sick of your stories i'm sick of your sh*t 
  i'm sick of your face so shut up and quit 
  i always hear you saying how you're so punk 
  i just wanna hear you shut the f*ck up 
  you always gotta act like a casualty 
  but you aint gettin my sympathy
