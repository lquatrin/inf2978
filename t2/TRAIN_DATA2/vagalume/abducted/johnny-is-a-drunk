All he ever does is sit around the house
And drinks and drinks
And when he drinks he drinks beast
Because it f*cks him up for cheap
Eins, zwei, drei, vier
Johnny drank all the beer
He drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks
And eric tells him what he thinks
The truth is out, his story's known
He drained the keg dry as a bone
