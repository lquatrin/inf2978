Ya know i've known you now
Known you now for a real long time
And i think it's time to take you
Take you out and make you mine
Wouldn't it be neat
I can see you now youre looking so sweet
Holding your hand in mine
Cause two hours is not enough time
So i'm asking you if you'll go with me to the drive-in
We'll park the car
It's just you and me while the film's rolling
So i'm asking you if you'll go with me to the drive in
Cause even if the movie sucks we still got eachother while the picture's
Rolling
