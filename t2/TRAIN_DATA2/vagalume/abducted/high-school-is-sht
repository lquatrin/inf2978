Sitting in the classroom pretending i'm alive
I couldn't get to sleep till 4 last night
Sitting here trying to keep from snoring
Every single day is so f*cking boring
Cause you know... high school is sh*t
The school shrink tells me to go too class
But i know i'm going nowhere fast
I can't believe they really think i'm so dumb
I just wanna kill everyone
