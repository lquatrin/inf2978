I see you walking down the street
I dunno what to say
You break my heart when you look away
I know you can't help it you look so good
But you cant get involved with a common street hood
Your friends make fun of me thats just my luck
All i am to them's some low rent punk
I see you coming & i start to shake
Yeah i've fallen for you and that's no mistake
You're breaking my heart & you know its true
I never thought i'd feel this blue
Cause i'll never stand next to you
I see you walking with your new boyfriend
I wanna kill him i cant pretend
I see him walking with his arm aroung you
Yeah he's gonna die that much is true
