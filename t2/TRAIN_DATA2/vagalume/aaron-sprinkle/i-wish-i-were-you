In these recent years I have noticed that your face has slightly changed
In this season of the bitter pill that pulled your heart away
In the daylight when it hits you straight on
see the lines in your face have begun
When I tell you that you're beautiful like a second hand that stopped
You remind me of a waterfall that turned the earth to mud
In this season of the bitter pill that pulled your heart away
Feel it coming in again
All that you've known up till now
you could trade for this thought I'm singing about
That now and again I'll play the fool
but I love you so much I wish I were you
All that you've known up till now
You could trade for this thought i'm singing about
That now and again I'll play the fool
But I love you so much I wish I were you
