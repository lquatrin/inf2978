Shake the water off my hands
And count the moments
That you really understand this disappointment
Tired of always waking up the darkest feeling
Think i'll open up these blinds and get to seeing
On a day much quieter than this
I will hold your hand and kiss your face
I think it's imperative you know that I am
Not about to
I know that you could feel
Like a girl on a ferris wheel
Falling down the stairs and then
We could do it again we could to it again...
On a day much quieter than this
I will hold your hand and kiss your face
I think it's imperative you know that I am
Not about to
When it seems like everything's fine
Just look up and close your eyes
And remember
It's imperative you know that I am
Not about to let it go
