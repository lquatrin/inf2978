Time goes by feelings unravel
Words they make come out like gravel
We're on that road again that makes me feel queasy
Makes me uneasy
Your hair looks nice when I think about it
When I tell you so, you as me to stop it
We're on that road again that makes me feel queasy
There's bound to me more ahead
So please take it easy
Take it easy
Reading all the signs in my mind as they pass us by
Helps me not to think
Thinking about how I'm only thinking of
what not to think
Makes me think of you
Time goes by feelings unravel
Words they make come out like gravel
We're on that road again that makes me uneasy
There's bound to be more ahead
So please take it easy
Take it easy
