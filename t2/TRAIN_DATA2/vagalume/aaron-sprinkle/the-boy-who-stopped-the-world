Don't think you could stop it now
I'd like to see you try somehow
Realize that it puts it all on you
There's nothing you can do
Right now you're sick and tired
You're feeling sad, feeling uninspired
But the clock just won't slow down
Like it gets it kicks pushing you around
Maybe in the morning it won't be
Quite as bad as it seems
The fact that you can't change
The speed of sound, the rate of age
Is an understatement to
A state of mind your not used to
You'd be forever known
As the boy who stopped the world
And made it his own
Right now you're sick and tired
You're feeling sad. feeling uninspired
So I pray for you my friend
That you'll fall down
You'll give in
