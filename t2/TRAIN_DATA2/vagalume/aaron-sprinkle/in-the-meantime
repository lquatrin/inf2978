She waits alone
She gets tired
As the day falls down
She seems uninspired
She won't wait
Much longer
And the tears held back
Make her stronger
In the meantime I get open eyed
To my lowly state of mind
The kindest thing
That she's seen
Is an open mouth
Without a scream
At her feet
Like water
The reflection there
Is getting darker
In the meantime I get open eyed
To my lowly state of mind
If I can't hear her
Will I ever know
A love that's meant to grow
All my life I've wondered how
The things I've been
Could make a difference in the end
But every day it seems more clear
I don't know how I'd make it through
If you weren't here
