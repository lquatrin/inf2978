You could have tried a little harder
You could have been a little stronger
Needed me more
With an ocean underneath me
Holding on to what tomorrow brings
But it's always a storm
All this time
Keepin' it in
Needed some kind of hope
But you couldn't begin
To see this doubt welling up in my eyes
Getting harder to swallow this disguise
I've been losing a war
I just can't fight anymore
I'm givin' up the gun, givin' up the gun
I'll live to love another day
Maybe someday you'll see
You made a martyr of me
I'm givin' up the gun, givin' up the gun
I'll live to love another day
I hope
That I can brush it off
When I get up again
Turn in and get some rest
I feel so old enough to know
What I should learn from this
What did I learn from this?
I will follow the Sun
And find my way home
I'm gonna go it alone
And maybe this time I'll find
Some peace of mind
