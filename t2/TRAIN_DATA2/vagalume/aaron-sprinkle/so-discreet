I see a swallow perched in front of me
Laughing with her eyes so sullenly
The I see a truck go down the way
No delivery for me today
There's a man upon a little bike
That makes him feel so big he can't decide
If he should give up scraping both his knees
For the sake of being so discreet
So discreet
Before I know it I am far away
The swallow looks so small she can't complain
I don't remember which warm house is mine
So I choose the one whose love is fine
Love is fine
