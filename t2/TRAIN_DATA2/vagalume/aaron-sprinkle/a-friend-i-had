And i have become much less
Wide eyed for your indiscretions
And i can't understand why you've chosen me
To keep those dreadful stories
Friendly
And your eyes are darker when
The sun hits your brow
You were young once but you're older now
You are older now
Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for
Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for
Will your faith be rewarded
And will you ever see
How can i know where you are love
When you're right beside me
When you're right beside me
Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for
Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for
You are older now
You are older now
You are older now
You are older now
