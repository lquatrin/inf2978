When it gets me back again
I'll be ready to begin
Ready to stand up to it
And it gets me back again
(chorus)
On my word i could never see it coming
Cause i never could keep up on
Anyone
You said you could
But you wouldn't
Tell me what to do
And i never could see through you
Even sometimes
On better days
You and I
Will figure this out
Push it down
Look behind
When it gets me back again
I'll be reeady to begin
Ready to stqand up to it
And it gets mee back again
(chorus)
(chorus repeats)
