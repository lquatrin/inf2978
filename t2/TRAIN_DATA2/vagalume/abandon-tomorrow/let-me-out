Today they woke me up
And strapped me in my bed
They sewed my mouth shut
So nothing can be said
The blood and agony
It's seeping through my teeth
Torture methods are so confined
Thoughts going through my mind
I want out, out of this god damn cage
I never thought that it would end this way
It's like a book, with blood on every page
The pain is something I don't want to tolerate
Vision is blurred, the ceiling lights blind me
No anesthesia, yet I can't feel my body
My consciousness slips away
When will they ever take me out of my misery?
I want out, out of this god damn cage
I never thought for that it would end this way
It's like a book, with blood on every page
The pain is something I don't want to tolerate
You can't keep me in this place
I've forgotten my name
Got a stinging feeling in my tongue
My life will never be the same
This is the abomination I've become
