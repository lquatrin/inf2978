The whole world is a big fucking lie
No heaven or hell, just the ground and the sky
There is no justice because it's always fading, and there's no world to admire, because it's desecrating
I can't decide if I should even fight these problems
If there can only be one who's always right
By the time we even find a solution
We are doomed to fight our own demons
This can't be something that overwhelms me
Thinking of what's right and wrong will make me lose my mind
Although the world around me is starting to grow dim
I've learned from experience, I won't give in
This is the art of giving in
I know I'm never gonna win
They may be dead with no feelings inside
But let's make sure that we have nothing left to hide
And while our words will let them know
Let's make sure that our actions are seen as the real show!
Seen as the real show
This can't be something that overwhelms me
Thinking of what's right and wrong will make me lose my mind
Although the world around me is starting to grow dim
I've learned from experience, I won't give in
This is the art of giving in
I know I'm never gonna win!
This is the art of giving in
I know I'm never gonna win!
You don't get what you deserve, you get what you take!
Nothing that's happened is a mistake!
You don't get what you deserve!
