Pull out the crucifix
Spirits awaken
Through the portal of lost souls
I cower in fear left to wonder
Changes in seasons are upon us now
Time flies as the clock ticks faster and faster
Crippling my train of thought
Echoes behind the door
The door stays shut for eternity
Behind the hinges are not meant for human eyes to see
It's not to be heard with our delicate ears
Within the block of wood lives your haunting fears
Temptations come to prove my ignorance
I just want another chance
Death is the only guarantee you have in life
The echoes of the deceased are all that's heard
Changes in seasons are upon us now
Time flies as the clock ticks faster and faster
Crippling my train of thought
Echoes behind the door
Unlock the hatch, swing away the creaking door
My life begins to fade away, draining my soul
Spirits pull me to my doom and my blood becomes ice cold
This is where I am condemned and the climax unfolds
