It's a rough day
especcialy when your name is Fay
I have big socks
and they don't fit my goat
Boom, Click, Soup
I have brown underwear
I like pasta
I like ink
I like to do the winky-dink
I like to shave my armpits
Inside my nose
Sometimes I fart
But... Noone is there
I begin to cry, and wonder if I should just die
It's like
I'd rather burp and puke
But I hate to do the Jukey-Juke
I sit in a chair, with my butt, bare
The chair is cold, but my great aunt is old
I have big shoes
But here I am, singing the blues
Big Socks
Big Socks
Big Socks
Big Socks
Big Socks
Big Socks
