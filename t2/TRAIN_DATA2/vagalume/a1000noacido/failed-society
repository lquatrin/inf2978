Destruction is in the cities
Who they'll choose to blame
Buildings burning down
Still stands the same
You must fight for your right
They will say
It's so hard to survive
Through these things
Play this game as hard as you can
Make your moves and take your choices
We all live the failed society
They don't call it failed society
The meaning of tomorrow
Is in somebody's hands
They don't believe in sorrow
They just believe in pain
You don't know what it cost
They will say
And the future is lost
Wasted pray
Play this game as hard as you can
Make your moves and take your choices
We all live the failed society
They don't call it failed society
The meaning of tomorrow
Is creeping in false hands
They don't believe in sorrow
They just believe in pain
You don't know what it cost
They will say
And the future is lost
Wasted pray
Play this game as hard as you can
Make your moves and take your choices
We all live the failed society
They don't call it failed society
