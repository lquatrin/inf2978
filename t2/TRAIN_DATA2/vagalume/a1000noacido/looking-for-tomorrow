There's a reason to sail through the seas
And this future is my legacy
If the wind blows all over my face
Maybe it leads on my trace
From the abyss we'll never return
In christ's blood then my fate was foretold
I've got honour that burns in my veins
Domination is my name
The victory ... is asking for me
Deprived .. of your own liberty
The vengeance .... the spirit of light
The conquest .... the meaning of life
If we look for tomorrow
We will see
Our courses shall go in two different seas
If we look for tomorrow
We will see
Our courses shall go in two different seas
Many miles i have travelled so far
Nothing more but my blade on my side
Try to make my own serenity
From my life's misery
Suddenly i see my enemies
Fight so hard 'till the end of my life
All i want is to beat them again
I shall die for my land
The victory ... is asking for me
Just deprived .. of your own liberty
The vengeance .... the spirit of light
The conquest .... the meaning of life
If we look for tomorrow
We will see
Our courses shall go in two different seas
If we look for tomorrow
We will see
Our courses shall go in two different seas
If we look for tomorrow
We will see
Our courses shall go in two different seas
If we look for tomorow
We will see
Ur courses shall go in two different seas
