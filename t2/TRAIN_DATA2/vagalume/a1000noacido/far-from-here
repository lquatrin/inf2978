All the people live
Ordinary lives, they despise each other
For their own survive, to be realize
They count all the crumbs on
And i don't know why
Why i'm putting you, in this situation
If you try to change, if you rearrange
Who am i to, question the one you became
There's a cry, deep inside ...
Many hopes you left
Many miles away, it's been lost in sorrows
And some peace of mind
Is so hard to find, many times you've tried
It's so real to me
I begin to see, pictures of tomorrow
Now you've found your way, you're just not the same
Who am i to, question the one you became
There's a cry, deep inside
Just get away, 'cause your life is slidding in time
There's a cry, deep inside
Just get away, 'cause your life is slidding in time
I'm too tired of just saying the same words
You don't have to be paying the price
Now my time is at a place far from here
Strange as strange it can be
I'm too tired of just saying the same words
You don't have to be paying this price
Now my time is at a place far from here
Strange as strange it can be
I'm too tired ...
You don't have to be paying this price
Now my time is at a place far from here
Strange as strange is can ...
Strange as strange it can be
