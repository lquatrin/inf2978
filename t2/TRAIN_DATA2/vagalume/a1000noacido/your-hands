To my roots of beginning i've got to come back
Cause that vision of fear i face every day
It's hot blood beating in my head
Wish to hell i was dead
So you took me from there, now it's time to forget
In your hands i am giving the chances of my life
'cause this crime i've commited, they'll never know why
It's stone cold, fire and pain
I've been wandering again
And even the promise i've made to myself
The fact did happen and will disappear someday
In your hands i am giving the chances of my life
'cause this crime i've commited, they'll never know why
It's stone cold, fire and pain
I've been wandering again
And even the promise i've made to myself
The fact did happen and will disappear someday
