Here i am again, starvin' and freezin'
I got this awfull feeling to be right by your side
And i am alone in this desert place
With these five old friends o'mine, i'm on my way to hell
Just to see if all my reasons are everything to me,
Oh....
Sometimes you drive me crazy, crazy for your love
I don't know just what to do, i still don't know who i am
Then you bring to me all your naked body
Again and again, this is all i want from you
If the feelings of the future are tears in my past
Oh...
Sometimes you drive me crazy, crazy for your love
I don't know just what to do, 'cause i still don't know who i am
Then you bring to me all your naked body
Again and again, this is all i want from you
If the feelings of the future are tears in my past
Oh...
