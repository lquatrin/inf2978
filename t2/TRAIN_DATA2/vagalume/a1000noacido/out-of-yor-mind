Did you cry when the story grew older and died ?
Many times it was all that i've tried to hide
If i just made you walk on through sorrow and pain
Only time will bring you back to life again
You remind me the questions i've left far behind
And the future is something that i can't deny
On and on ..... i just keep on telling you that
It's not time .... to anger, to madness, to die
'cause our way ... is over but you can't accept it
'cause you're out of your mind
Out of your mind
You remind me the questions i've left far behind
And the future is something that i can't deny
On and on ..... i just keep on telling you that
It's not time .... to anger, to madness, to die
'cause our way ... is over but you can't accept it
'cause you're out of your mind
Out of your mind
