Look at the mirror
And see the choices of your life again
Just look the mirror
And see the lies commanding all the humanity
Time after time
I still see a tear in your eyes
It's time to recognize the fears
Loneliness in your mind
Depression in your life
I can't believe in this way
But your need to believe
That the dreams are still alive
See the hope across the mirror
Cause it never dies
Look at the mirror
And see the choices of your life again
Just look the mirror
And see the lies commanding all the humanity
