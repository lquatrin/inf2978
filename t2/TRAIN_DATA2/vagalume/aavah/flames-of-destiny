Confused feelings
And words so hard to say
The end of the fate so expected
Nothing to ease the pain
We know how it starts
And we know how it ends
But the endless circles will be broken
Someday I hope, to understand
The winter's Queen is waiting
A knight coming from the sea
Her dreams changed into a tragedy
Her pride was wounded
But inside the fire
All curse will be undone
Only fire can give peace
Burning down to ashes
The Flames of the Destiny
Will shine inside of us
For the eternity
Until the end of the world
When the half-dead sun
Falls in darkness
Our immortal flames
Will still remain
