All hail to a fascist police state
Assent the doctrines of a despotic leader
An ordered violation of our human rights
Blood-stained soil no longer stands for freedom
Economic warfare has burned the constitution
Acceptance will void our foundation
To support the unjust is not patronage
It's our obligation to reject and disobey
Our hearts and minds
Will not submit
Our hearts and minds
Won't be controlled!
