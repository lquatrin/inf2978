Once kissed in this rain
But now tears stream down her face
Controlled, broken, and lost
Without resource to sustain
A choice stripped away
Morals lacking thought
Graze of skin
Touch of death
Or create life
Unto affliction
Raped by blind ignorance
Of Man and Holy Spirit
Condemned to burn forever
And suffer in silence
Anyone with a cock
Has no right to decide
Devoid of sentient viability
[Solo: Brandon]
Keep your hands of their fucking bodies
Forced to revert to endless malpractice
Spoken for by the blood on her coat hanger
