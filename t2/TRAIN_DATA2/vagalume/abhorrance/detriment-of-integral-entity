what happened to your integrity?
i remember a fire that used to burn
your heart used to bleed for your passion
now your flame has died and turned into blackened ash
your heart still beats
but you are already dead
your volition denies your validity
compromising your music is only the antithesis of your betterment
watered down
false morale
apostatize
true music is an expression from within
not to be tainted to inherit benefits
of lucre and voguishness
you've become weak and withered
you're bleeding artificial blood
are your false ideals supposed to make you great?
you have no deep blood left to shed
you are nothing
