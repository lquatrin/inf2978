when i think i see the light, its just the glow of the flames that burn me
you overlook any values that i hold. sorry i don't live up to your fucked up ideals
nothing is ever good enough for your standards. Your own ignorance is your demise
open hands, trusting heart for you to see. turn away and tread on me
self pity is a self righteous lie
you shove me down despite my countless efforts
stand above me as you watch me fall
but its your song the violins will play
superficial imagination bearing down on you, making you believe no one cares
reached out a hand you disregarded now i know my day won't ever come
for you have overlooked everything i've cared, you've failed to observe who i really am
when you realize what's important, i'll be the only one who will still care
self pity is a self righteous lie
you shove me down despite my countless efforts
stand above me as you watch me fall
but its your song the violins still play
resentment for ever trying to see your mind
this wound doesn't look so good
when the knife is sticking in the back
watch me fall!
