your head is in the clouds though you don't know who the fuck you are
the pain, now hate is burning. you're denying what's in here
your inability to relate is prominent - i fall apart
stopped breathing. depression wins; stuck in echoing corridors of wrath!
[stuck in here with wrath]
the stress and neglect and the pains that you bring are weighted as your black heart
i give a cry out; receive refusal as you fuck the world in the ass
no one to confide in, wanna place to hide in, wanna lock myself in a world of seclusion
superficial assholes endured here. i better leave this place before i smell like tuna-fish
sometimes I want to murder the world
i feel no way out. lonely- sad- i want to cut myself off
[Nothing will be lost]
the stress and neglect and the pains that you bring are weighted as your black heart
i give a cry out; receive refusal as you fuck the world in the ass
wouldn't it be nice to see the world on a rope, decorating the trees?
