We've reached a time where rhetoric
Holds greater value than evidence
From the Bible to Government
Instilling fear in the idiots
The feeding hand is a killing hand
Empowered by blind demand
A corporate sponsored holocaust
The popular vote at a loss
The rulers swindle riches
While real workers slave
We give our lives to serve their fucked-up interest
Consented by the blinded moral right
Offenses abroad perpetuate the global hate
Surrender of rights for protection
Gives the President an erection
Trusted leaders are the oppressors
Selling-out our democracy
[Solo 1: Patrick]
[Solo 2: Brandon]
Reject consumerism
Burn the motherfuckers
Shroud in a blazing flag
Reciprocate altruism
Pax-American globalization
