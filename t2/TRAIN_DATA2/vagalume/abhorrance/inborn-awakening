Two points opposing in negative space
(Who casts the light?)
And who's sucked into the black whole?
Is it possible light is cast by evil?
What's accepted is the-down-fall!
In darkness we are breeding the revolution
(In defiance)
Of superficial expectations
Values displayed for denigration
Inside ourselves we're all beau-tif-ul!
Fuck the image
Of indifference
Fuck perfection
Of senseless fashion
This is my anamnesis
I am recalling my existence
If our values can be so easily discarded
For the uniformity we are not
Why the fuck should we live up to impress?
We shan't be made to feel worthless!
