i'm alone in this life, i'm isolated, untouched by a lending hand
my self worth taken for granted
i can be seen, but could never be reached, i am on a different level
anxious solitude never understood
give an inch and they'll take a mile
give a hand and they'll tear my fucking heart out
give my heart and they'll steal my will
in turn for my life you're going to die tonight
i scream out the words, an abstraction of mind, belittled and discarded
my message conveyed yet never understood
i'm rotting from the inside, in writhing anguish, lost control and dominated
i can't stand this fucking way i feel
i want to fucking kill!
give an inch and they'll take a mile
give a hand and they'll tear my fucking heart out
give my heart and they'll steal my will
in turn for my life you're going to die tonight
i want your blood, i want your soul
i'll take revenge and have complete control
i'll make you suffer, i want to hear you scream in pain
i'll tear off your limbs, and i'll slurp down your brains
you take a little, and you stretch it to all
i will express my emotions, as you make me small
deny valid intuition, i'll tear you from your pedestal
goodnight parasite, you're going to die to-fucking-night!
