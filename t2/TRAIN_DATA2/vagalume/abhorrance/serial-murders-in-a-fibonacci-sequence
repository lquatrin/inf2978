I can't stand the fucking sound of your name
Triggering indignation
Marauding eyes defile innocence portrayed
Drop like a shot
At a loss for words
I cannot enjoy this atmosphere
Superficial minds cannot comprehend
The beauty of the insane
(Fuck you)
I'll never change for you
And I shall keep this shred dignity
(Usurper of my heart)
Put this gun to my head
And paint this beautiful
Fucking portrait
With my abstract mind
I'll kill these worthless emotions
And you fucking masqueraders
I'll pull the fires from the skies and burn the goddess
Vendetta ammunition
Fervent hatred
End neurotic animus
I will kill this worthless emotion called love
I want to fucking kill
