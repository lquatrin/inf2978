keep changing the molds, the ones i could never fit into
keep raising the standard and all you expect out of me
you are all the things i could never be
once your equal, i have become an ever-growing disappointment
build up these walls
keep me behind
i am beautiful in my own merit
a significance of individuality
inconceivable to the mind that does not ponder
strip away my flesh to reveal this deep blood that flows through my veins
talk your shit, saying i'm losing my sanity
you don't care to take the time to examine me
you no longer know anything about me or who i am
you don't know the first thing about all my fucking hate
these tears i've shed
convert to blood
i am beautiful in my own merit
a significance of individuality
inconceivable to the mind that does not ponder
strip away my flesh to reveal this deep blood that flows through my veins
being you is something i could never achieve
i can fucking feel real emotions true and deep
i am free from your fear of shame
i am deeper in what i feel
love. strength. passion. hate.
