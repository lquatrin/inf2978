still of night consumes my soul
i hear your name on the winter's window pane
hands folded, perched in this darkness... alone
demonic eyes gazing in nocturnal reign
wine-red night beneath my cold flesh
scorned and stolen everything entwined within
my heart has been lacerated without final endearing touch
the wind blows a haunting anecdotic deathly feel like a fatal sin
i shall tear open your chest and eat your heart out
as your sweet tasting blood drips down my lips
the wind will howl your name
i'll look in to your evil dying eyes
and give you this final graven kiss
