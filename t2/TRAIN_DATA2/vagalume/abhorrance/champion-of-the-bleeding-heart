every day's the same
nothing is ever changing
i don't want to see another day
cause it hurts too much inside
we all fall but no one wants to reach out a hand
tomorrow's a brand new day
the pouring rain is the only one who will listen
i want to bury myself in your arms and hear you whisper me assuring words
my water is cracking and my soul is broken by your demonic demise
we all fall! we all fall!
all of our hearts have fallen out of sync
we all fall! we all fall!
this becoming the object of my demented dreams
everyday! everyday!
tomorrow never brings a change
everyday! everyday!
anxiety delivering my extinction
i'm not going to wake up today
i will sleep this life away
i can sleep assured knowing you will never
walk by my side with your hand in mine
