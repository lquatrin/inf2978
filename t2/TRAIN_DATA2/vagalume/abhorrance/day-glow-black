see you all the time i like to look into you eyes
the words crawl up to my tongue but slip back way inside
i'd like to be with you i'd like to kiss your lips
fill my void with you, stop the world with this bliss
i can't speak but i want to be with you
so confused and i don't know what to do
i'm the king of wishful thinking
but i am too insecure
awake at night as i'm lying in my bed
the image of you envelops my head
i want to walk you to your door and kiss you goodnight
play with your hair. make everything all right
i can't speak but i want to be with you
so confused and i don't know what to do
i'm the king of wishful thinking
but i am too insecure
