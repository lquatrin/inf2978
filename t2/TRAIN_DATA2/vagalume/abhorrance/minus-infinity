three weeks, i told myself, it would take for me to fall in love
three more weeks, i told myself, it would take to fall apart
three weeks marked my self-destruction
i burn eternally for you as you tear my heart apart
i wouldn't wish myself upon anybody
emotionlessly cast me away to burn in hell
only full of desire to endure all pain inflicted by you
i worship you before this alter in my mind
i'll sacrifice myself for your wicked kiss, just to be with you
the queen sits high upon her throne
this pedestal i have created for you
i wouldn't want to contaminate your flawless
perfection with my infectious presence
building an empire
destroying hearts one at a time
still i want this abuse from you
reject all that i have to offer
drain all the blood out of me
you are an art display of angelic perfection
you are a master of deception
you're so beautiful with sweetest lips of sin
but contain malice to kill me from within
i would never wish you upon anybody
i constantly feel you pumping through my veins
abruptly discard me and drive me more insane
i keep striving to reach inside your heart
but in your eyes i'll never attain perfection
the vixen sits upon the throne of hell
this pedestal i have created for you
i wouldn't want to contaminate your flawless
perfection with my infectious presence
no empire lasts
i will be the only one left standing
to watch you when you fall
and you will fall
