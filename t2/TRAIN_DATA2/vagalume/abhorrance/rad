the champ is going down!
run this blade into my heart
spill the blood of my life
i fail with all that i try
i've given up on myself
don't try to erase the past
yesterday is dead and gone
live one day at a time
every day is brand new
live full speed ahead
don't ever have regrets
learn from all experiences gained
overcome pain with strength
these stitches in my heart
don't represent hardship or heart break
they are symbols of my strength
healing my wounds
a recovery from sorrow
keeping my blood within me
instead of bleeding to death
i heal myself with strength
live full speed ahead
don't ever have regrets
learn from all experiences gained
overcome pain with strength
create your own destiny
reach out and grab life by the balls
and fucking pull and twist
have the strength to live on
take the power to say fuck you
to the memories of yesterday
live full speed ahead
