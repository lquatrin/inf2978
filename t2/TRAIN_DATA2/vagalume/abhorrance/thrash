an internal chemistry releasing my mind
a self produced caffeine empowering my life
churning speed and chord progressions wrapped around my spine
an orgasmic emulation synced with signature of time
a concoction of blood and sweat
the abstraction of the circle pit
pumping fists and screaming voices
uprooting aggressions deep inside
this feeling is the ultimate release
its a fire fueled by the elements of life
the stronger we can build this unit is
the harder we can release this energy
this music is what i grew up on so its part of my life
its even rooted deeper than feelings of love
love as well as every thing fades and dies with time
but playing is my true passion the lasts through time
my melancholy and fatigue
sometimes tend to dominate me
but when i tap into this energy
i'm reformed with adrenaline and strength
this feeling is the ultimate release
its a fire fueled by the elements of life
the stronger we can build this unit is
the harder we can release this energy
i'm not giving up until i've engraved my mark
or i know i died trying to save my goals
its a fire within me fueled by passion
