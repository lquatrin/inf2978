You think the world will melt if you whistle
There's a certain spring in your stride
You face the future like a heat-seeking missile
You've got yourself a smile a mile wide
(Yes, you have)
Viva Love
Viva Love, Viva Love, Viva Love
Viva Love
Viva, viva
When lightning strikes you don't look for shelter
You're floating free, gravity defied
It's hell for leather on a helter skelter
So steel your nerves for a bright white knuckle ride
(Yes, you should)
Viva Love
Viva Love, Viva Love, Viva Love
Viva Love
Viva, viva
In the battle of the sexes
Victory's denied
I'm charging your tanks
With slingshots and knives
My troops they retreat
And run for their lives
I'm facing defeat
But somehow love survives
Viva Love
Viva Love, Viva Love, Viva Love
Viva Love
Viva, viva
You think the world will melt if you whistle
There's a certain spring in your stride
(Fade)
