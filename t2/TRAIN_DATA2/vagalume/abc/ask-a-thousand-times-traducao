When Im high, youre low
When Im up, youre down
And were never around
When we need each other
Back stabbing
You know that I bleed
I just know youll disagree
* ask a thousand times
A thousand times Ill see no
Love is never blind
Though sometimes you might think so
Ask a thousand times
A thousand times youll hear me say
Love is like a weapon
When youre back stabbing me
When Im weak, youre strong
When Im all right, youre all wrong
And we dont get along
Anymore
Back stabbing
You know where that leads
I just know youll disagree
(* repeat two times)
When Im high, youre low
When Im weak, youre strong
(* repeat two times)
