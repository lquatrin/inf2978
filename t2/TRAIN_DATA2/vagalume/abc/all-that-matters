I believe that this world was made for everyone
I can see all that wealth won't make a champion
All that matters in my world (life)
All that matters to me is you
Only you, Only you
All that matters, Only you
I don't care what people say, what people do
(let 'em talk)
I don't share that state of mind, that point of view
(let 'em sue)
(Chorus)
From the top of my head to the tip of my toes
From the sole of my shoes through every stitch in my clothes
Each beat of my heart, each molecule
All that matters to me is you
All that matters to me is you
All that matters to me is you
Believe me it's true
(You're all that matters)
Now I wish you'd believe it too
Only you, Only you
