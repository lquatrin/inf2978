I held an iron fist in a velvet glove
I was silk sheathed in steel
I'd disguise every nerve inside of me
Man, I'd forgotten how to feel.
You made me feel so much stronger
This must be magic
You made me feel someone with your love
This must be magic (Yes you remade me)
This must be love (Yes you persuaded me)
This must be magic (You won't betray me)
This must be love
I was the hawk not the dove gave up on love
Chasing rainbows, chasing wealth
One angry young man in my own Vietnam
At war with the world but just killing myself
You made me feel so much stronger
This must be magic
You made me feel someone with your love
This must be magic (Yes you impressed me)
This must be love (You must have blessed me)
This must be magic (When you carress me)
This must be love
You made me feel so much stronger
This must be magic
You made me feel someone with your love
This must be magic (You resurrect me)
This must be love (Swore you'd protect me)
This must be magic (Say you'll respect me)
This must be love
This must be, must be, must be love.
