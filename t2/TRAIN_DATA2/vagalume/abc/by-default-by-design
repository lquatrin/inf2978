By default by design
Time after time
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
You got it
Call it attraction or charm
Sound the alarm
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
Yes, you got it
Breaking hearts your speciality? 
Why did you ever have to come so close to me
Was it love or morbid curiosity? 
Either way I'd say that loves a possibility
Come a little closer,
Let me see you in close detail
The object of my affections
Walked off in the other direction
By default by design
Time after time
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
You got it
Call it attraction or charm
Sound the alarm
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
Yes, you got it
Modern day romeos,
Modern day juliets
Selling their love for a packet of cigarettes
Still I remember the day that we first met...
And yet so far, so good
So what else can we ever expect? 
Come a little closer, let me see you in close detail
The object of my affections walked off in the other direction
By default by design
Time after time
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
You got it
Call it attraction or charm
Sound the alarm
Maybe you earned it,
Maybe you spurned it
But you got it...
Yes, you got it
