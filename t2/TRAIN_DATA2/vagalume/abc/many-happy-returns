When I accepted this job
I was resigned to my fate
When I got there early
Shed arrive late
You can say shes gone forever
Or just sit tight and wait
She said I was unprincipled
That I was not the first
Like the phoenix coming back
From the ashes, uh-huh
I know whats good,
But I know what trash is
In the head-lights,
In the highlights of her hair...
Hit the head lines
But she's not there:
Many happy returns
Many happy returns
These are the lessons I could have learned
Return. many happy returns
And these are the letters I should have burned
Okay, I'm sad, not blue
Okay, remember
All that matters to me now
Is the message I sent her
Like the world, spinning round
On its axis, uh-huh
I know democracy
But I know whats fascist
When she's gone, all I got to learn
Is the law of diminishing return
When shes here, one thing I've found
Things get better second time around
Many happy returns
Many happy returns
These are the lessons I could have learned
Return. many happy returns
And these are the letters I should have burned
Okay I'm sad, not blue
Okay, remember
All that matters to me now
Is the message I sent her
Now she's gone, she's gone away
Now she's gone forget her
Coming back another day
If youd only let her
Now she's gone, she's gone away
But she's gone forget her
Coming back another day
So why resurrect her? 
Many happy returns
Many happy returns
These are the lessons I could have learned
Return. many happy returns
And these are the letters I should have burned
