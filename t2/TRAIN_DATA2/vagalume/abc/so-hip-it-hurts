Do you remember when men wore skirts? - so hip!
In kipper ties like jealous flirts - so hip!
In calico and in brocade shirts - so hip it hurts!
Do you remember when girls wore slacks? - so hip!
Traffic stops, men get heart attacks - so hip!
Seems so strange that they took it like that - so hip it hurts!
He's so hip - so hip it...
She's so hip - so hip it...
They're so hip - so hip it hurts!
So hip it...
Whose the girl with the kinski eyes? - so hot!
They kind of face you could idolise - so what!
The kind of shape that gets advertised - so hip it hurts!
Once it was normal for a girl to curtsey
I'll admit even though it hurts me
She'd squeeze informal until it screams for mercy
So hip it hurts!
He's so hip - so hip it...
She's so hip - so hip it...
They're so hip - so hip it hurts!
So hip it hurts!
So hip it...
Afro-wigs on albino squares...
Polka-dots on alpaca flares...
Solar powered electric chairs...
So hip it hurts
