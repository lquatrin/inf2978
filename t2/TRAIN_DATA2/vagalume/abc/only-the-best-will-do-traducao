Elegant faces
Won't you stand aside
Im only looking for the real ride
Nows not the time
To run away and hide
I've got no time for fakers
Only the best will do
Looking through my eyes, baby
It's such a spectacular view
Now that these times are changing
Only the best will do
Pale imitations
Will fade away
People are talking
With nothing to say
I wouldnt let anyone
Talk to me that way
I've got no time for fakers
You
Ain't that peculiar
Neptunes your ruler
Awake from your slumber
Give me your number
How candid the camera
That captures the best of you
Only the best will do
I've got no time for fakers
Only the best will do
(repeat with following)
Ain't that peculiar
Only the best will do
