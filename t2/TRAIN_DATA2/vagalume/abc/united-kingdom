There's a gang I've just joined
There's a gang I've just joined
Three million strong youd agree
Four million strong youd agree
Enrollment was easy, so easy
Getting out proves to be the difficulty
From lands end to john ogroats
From lands end to john ogroats
They are making ends meet
Mending holes in their coat
Fasting and feasting on bread and margarine
Burning dreams build upon buried hopes
United kingdom - you'd better ring them
You've a solution - you better bring them
United kingdom - united kingdom
You've a solution - you better bring them
Opportunity, I guess they all came and went
Finding it hard
Finding the rent you'll find it funny
With your finger running down
Situations vacant
In school he was an athlete
Now hes not so self-assured
After all of these o-levels is this my reward? 
Theres a silent majority, thats seen and
Never heard from charles i, charles ii
To charles iii
United kingdom - you'd better ring them
You've a solution - you better bring them
United kingdom - united kingdom
This busted, rusted, upper-crusted
Bankrupted done and dusted
No-man-to-be-trusted united kingdom
Proud to stand beneath the union jack? 
Happy dealing up a no ace pack? 
Polishing black boots
Priming the riot squad
There go I but for the grace of god
Covering up the agony with mindless entertainment
You'll be happy when theyre ripping up the pavement
Bringing down the axe on steelworks and foundries
Someone said love knows no boundaries
Close your eyes and think of england
Lie back and think of her
United kingdom - you better ring them
You've a solution - you better bring them
