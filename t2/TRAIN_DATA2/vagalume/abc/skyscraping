It's four o'clock, and the bells are ringing
The sun is in the sky
I hear the song that the breeze is bringing
I smile and close my eyes
Slowly drifting deeper and deeper inside
I hear your voice whispering softly
We're leaving the world outside
Just hold my hand and we'll go skyscraping
So high, you and I
If your mama asks you, say we're just escaping
We're gonna be sky high
Time flies, but I don't know where it's going
You vanish in the haze
Sometimes I wish that life could be everlasting
These are our Polaroid days
Slowly melting, the sun slips from the sky
I see your face, but it's fading quickly
We're leaving the world behind
Just hold my hand and we'll go skyscraping
So high, you and I
If your mama asks you, say we're just escaping
We're gonna be sky high
(Repeat)
We're gonna be sky high
You and me, so high
It's gonna be all right
