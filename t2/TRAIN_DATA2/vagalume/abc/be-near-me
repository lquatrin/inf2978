The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
Ever had that feeling, almost broke in two?
Said that you were leaving, like you do. You do?
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears in tears
Be near me, be near, be near...
Never had that feeling, until I first met you
Never felt like kneeling, now I do. Yes I do
Be near me, be near
What's your reputation? Ecstasy!
What's your destination? Next to me!
