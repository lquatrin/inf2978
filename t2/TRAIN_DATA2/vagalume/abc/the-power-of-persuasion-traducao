Cock a snoot
Loop the loop
Hock the hula-hoop
But now it yo-yo'd back again
Shiver me timbers
Just jumped ship with a little faith
We could win the championship
Parachute, stash the loot
Parachute substitute problem is it's soo cute
Workless, cashless, hungry and in debt
Outta house, outta home, outta pocket
They persuade you
That they made you then betrayed you
And they blame you with the power of persuasion
The power of persuasion
The power of persuasion
The power of persuasion
You bought the troll
You bought the gonk
You took it home And put it on a pedestal
We needed a saviour
But from its behaviour
Why did it have to be so extra-terrestrial?
Tax deductible Cash corruptible
Never the less another poolswinner
Penniless dog tooth check
Cash and carry
Find a girl
Settle down and marry
They persuade you
That they made you
They proclaim
And they'll maim you with the
The power of persuasion
The power of persuasion
The power of persuasion
I sold the Eskimo snow
Build the skyline outta playdo
Persuading you that monochrome is dayglo
With the power of persuasion
