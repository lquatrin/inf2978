I never promised you eternity
I never meant to be unkind
All I gave
You returned to me
But love's the last thing on my mind
Nothing in this world's invincible
No-one's heart is made of stone
And though I know I'm yours in principle
I'm the one thing you'll never own
If you can live your life without me
Turn and walk away
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
If you can't stand a single moment
Then go
But kiss me goodbye
Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye
I never promised you infinity
I never swore on oath for you
Did you expect the holy trinity
In all I say and all that I do?
If you can live your life without me
Turn and walk away
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
If you can't stand a single moment
Then go
But kiss me goodbye
Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye
It's not emotional extravagance
We've said farewell a thousand times
Why pretend there'll be a second chance
Unless this last kiss changes you mind?
If you can live your life without me
Turn and walk away
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
If you can't stand a single moment
Then go
But kiss me goodbye
Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me
Kiss me goodbye
Kiss me goodbye
