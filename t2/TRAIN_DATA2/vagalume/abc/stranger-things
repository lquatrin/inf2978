I would walk away from you
If thats what you wanted
But when you look for something new
You can be so disappointed
It's funny how it used to be
Me for you and you for me
I wish I knew why people change
Suddenly
Will we ever be the same again
Stranger things have happened
Will we ever feel this way again
Whatever will be will be
We were learning to be human
But it doesn't take a degree
To know that what you're looking for
Is not always what you see
It's funny how it used to be
Will we ever be the same again
Will we ever be the same again
Eternally
Sha la, sha la la
Sha la, sha la la
Sha la, sha la la
