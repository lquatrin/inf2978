Some men seek solace
Some take to drink
Some men find knowledge, yeah
At least thats what they think
Some take to violence
Streamlining their dreams
Some sit in silence
And learn what love can mean
Much further to go
Much further to crawl
But one day youll find
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
The load is tough
The path is long
Strewn with rocks, yeah
But youd be wrong, so wrong
One single spark
Can start a prairie fire
When one man speaks truth
He fills this world with pure desire
Much further to go
Much further to crawl
But one day youll find
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
One day united
One day free
You'll be rewarded
The one true path is unity
Fruit don't fall
Too far from the tree
One day well bathe
In true humility
Much further for truth
Much further to fall
I pray that you'll find
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
The greatest love of all
