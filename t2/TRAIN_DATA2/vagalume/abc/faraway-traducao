What a state to be in
It's a world of indecision
So self destructive
And such an ugly business
In and out of fashion
You always leave your mark
An indefinite decision
A dangerous remark
When you're cold and tired
When you're cold and tired
Don't turn your head away
The distance thats between us
Gets bigger every day
How come you never see
You're as faraway as faraway can be
You're as faraway as faraway can be
You try so hard to impress
You talk the telephone to death
It's what you can't see that counts
But you haven't worked that out yet
There is no reason
There is no plan
The truth can be deceptive
From such a quiet man
Theres madness in your words
Not wishing to be heard
But just like yesterday
You've already slipped away
How come you never see
When you're cold and tired
How come you never see
You're as faraway as faraway
As faraway as faraway
As faraway as faraway
As faraway as faraway
As faraway as faraway
As faraway from me as you can be
