Love's a dangerous language
Survey the damage
See what love has done
Oh, my precious darling my sacred angel
Look what we've done 
Oh, you're scared and frightened
Don't be afraid yes
We'll take your problem wheel
Drive it slowly to a shallow grave 
So in those special moments
That might make you think you were happy then
Moving blue through pink but you're happy now
And you think you'll sink 
The buckle is tied for a white knuckle ride
When the buckle is tied
Then the judgements denied 
Oh, my own she vixen we're sworn to secrecy, this crime is ours
Yeah, so quench your thirst
And when I'm hungry
I'll eat my words 
So in those special moments
That might make you think you're happy now
Moving blue through pink you were happy then
But you think you'll sink 
The buckle is tied for a white knuckle ride
When the buckle is tied,
Then the judgements denied wherever we go
Wherever we hide
In the white of your eyes
I see the feelings just died
