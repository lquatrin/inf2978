Vandals in ermine
Rip city skylines
Dodge truth and virtue
With slick city bylines
A paragon of virtue
Until they hurt you
In power and in status
We know they hate us
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Power is preaching
The virtues of poverty
Poor are left feeding
On cruel comedy...sad laughter
Rescue us all now
From fumes that choke us
Shift then these sad lives
Into sweet focus
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Prestige it sits high
On mammons alter
Porsche hungry pinheads
On champagne and oysters
Head full of hollow thoughts
Handful of sushi
Plug into dallas babe
Plug into dynasty
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Now i am loving
Where once i was hating
Leading a good life
Stopped paging satan
Played devils advocate
So many times
Lived in the shadows
But the sun will shine. shine. shine
So where is the heaven
And where is there love?
Where the hell is the heaven?
That you're so proud of
Where is the kingdom?
You say we squander?
Where the hell is the heaven?
Must we wait much longer?
