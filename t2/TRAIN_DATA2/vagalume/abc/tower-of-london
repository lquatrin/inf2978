Let me take you to trafalgar square
Let me take you there
Every streets a fashion catwalk
Everyones debonair
Let me take you to piccadilly
Guess it leads somewhere
Tower over centuries, tower over london
Tower up and frankly I'm amazed
Whats done can not be undone, not here not in london
Whats done can never be erased
So, tower up! - it's those little things
Make life interesting- tower of london!
Tower up! - wasting time
Yours and mine - tower of london!
Hip london! hip london!
Let me take you to St.Jamess square
Let me groove you there
Diplomats get target practice
In the open air
Psychobillies scream blue murder
Then they hit mayfair
Tower over centuries, tower over london
Tower up and frankly I'm amazed
What's done can not be undone, not here not in london
What's done can never be erased
So, tower up! - it's those little things
Make life interesting- tower of london!
Tower up! - wasting time
Precious time - tower of London!
Tower up! I'll meet you there
I'll be there - tower of London
New york! - don't make me laugh
I've seen photographs - tower of London...
