There's so much panic in this world
But we are living in the best
Of all possible worlds
Fear of the world
No fear, no fear of the world
Deep inside of me
We'll I got this wanderlust
Remember how we talked last night? 
We'll it's just as we discussed
Ashes turn to ashes
Cash turns to dust
Theres no-one in this world right now
You think you can trust
No real bruises I can show
Travelling the world on the radio
No real scars I can display
Burning up tomorrow into yesterday
Fear of the world
No fear, no fear of the world
Deep inside of me
In the seat of my pants
Theres a pain as big and hard
As a civil disturbance
Conquer all your fears
Seize every chance
In the end make fear your friend
And change your circumstance
No real bruises I can show
Travelling the world on the radio
No real scars I can display
Burning up tomorrow into yesterday
Fear of the world
No fear, no fear of the world
Fear of the world
No fear, no fear of the world
