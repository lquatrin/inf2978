Boy got paparazi, rich lead to slum
Let him think the grass is greener, it always is for someone
Pilgrims and penitents, saying it's the end of the world
Let them wallow in their sorrow
I want to live like there's no tomorrow, with you girl
World turns (world turns)
Spins round (spins round)
Goes round and around and around and around
I'm spellbound
All day (all day)
All night (all night)
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
I'm spellbound
Sun probes and moon shots explore the universe
Outer space must be a great place
Yet we're stranded here on earth
With tit for tat killers, junkie gurus
Let them wallow in their sorrow
I want to live like there's no tomorrow, just with you
(I want to live, just with you)
World turns (world turns)
Spins round (spins round)
Goes round and around and around and around
I'm spellbound
All day (all day)
All night (all night)
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
I'm spellbound (I'm spellbound)
Spellbound
World turns (world turns)
Spins round (spins round)
Goes round and around and around and around
I'm spellbound
All day (all day)
All night (all night)
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down, shake it down
I'm spellbound
When we gonna learn, when we gonna learn to turn
When we gonna learn to turn this world around
When we gonna learn, when we gonna learn to turn
When we gonna learn to turn this world around
(When we, when we gonna learn, show me, show me when)
When we gonna learn, when we gonna learn to turn
When we gonna learn to turn this world around
