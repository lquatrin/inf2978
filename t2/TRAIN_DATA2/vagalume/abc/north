Sun beats hard
On sunset boulevard
Much harder still
In notting hill
A northwind blows
And carries me home
Carries my heart, carries my soul
When cool silks they turn to suede
When young dreams are torn and frayed
The south feels so cold and grey
Today! today the norths too many miles away
Today! today I got to get away
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged
It's all gone silent
The light begins to fade
One man unplugs
The penny arcade
A northwind blows
And carries me home
Carries my heart, carries my soul
When cool silks they turn to suede
When young dreams are torn and frayed
The south feels so cold and grey
Today! today the norths too many miles away
Today! today I got to get away
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged
One sweet bouquet
The flowers strewn
The petals scattered
Here in the north
No dreams are shattered
I'm driving north
I'm heading home
I'm driving back
To the place I once belonged
No we don't feel angry
No we don't feel betrayed
Unlike our fathers
We don't remember better days
No we don't feel angry
No we don't feel betrayed
We just live
In this day and age
