When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you
All I'm saying, it takes a lot to love you
All I'm doing, you know it's true
All I mean now, there's one thing
Yes one thing that turns this grey sky to blue
That's the look, that's the look
The look of love
When your girl has left you out on the pavement (Goodbye)
Then your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living's your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means
Who's got the look? I don't know the answer to that question
Where's the look? If I knew I would tell you
What's the look? Look for your information
Yes there's one thing, the one thing that still holds true (What's that?)
That's the look, that's the look
The look of love
If you judge a book by the cover
Then you'd judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me I go from one extreme to another
And though my friends just might ask me
They say "Martin maybe one day you'll find true love"
I say "Maybe, there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing, we can't find"
That's the look, that's the look
The look of love
That's the look, that's the look
The look of love
That's the look, that's the look
The Look of love
