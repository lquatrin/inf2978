At night when everything is quiet
This old house seems to breath a sight
Sometimes I can hear a neighbor snoring
Sometimes I can hear a baby cry
Sometimes I can hear a staircase creaking
Sometimes a distant telephone
Oh, and when the night settle down again
This old house and I are all alone
Lonely house, lonely me
Funny with so many neighbors
how lonesome you can be
Lonely town, lonely street
Funny, you can be so lonely
With all this folks around
I guess there must be something
I don't comprehend
Sparrows have company
Even stray dogs have a friend
The night for me is not romantic
Unhook the stars and take they down
I'm lonely in the lonely town, in this lonely house
The night, the night for me is not romantic
Unhook stars and take they down
I'm lonely in this lonely town, in this lonely house
At the night when everything is quiet
