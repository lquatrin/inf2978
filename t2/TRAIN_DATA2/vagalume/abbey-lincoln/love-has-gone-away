Love has gone away hidding a side with no regrets
For yesterday hiding a side love said goodbye
So with sad and love, love walked away, a spirit child
Love had to go, loves has to play, love went away, away from from a place of fools in in pain
With teardrops and heartaches all again
Only a game of hitching and love
Af frouning together
Of kiss or shoulder
Pritching for my heart
Love walked away, saying to leave, but ready to stay
Love walked away
Love walked away
Loved walked away and walked away with love.
It change for my heart, love walked away
Sad in to leave, ready to stay
Love walked away
Love walked away
Love walked away, and I walked away with love.
