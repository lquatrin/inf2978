Down here below...
The winds of change are blowing
Through the weary night.
I prayed my soul will find me
Shining in the morning light,
Down here below.
Down here below,
It's not so easy
Just to be.
Sometimes I'm really all at sea.
You made me when the world was new
And skies were blue...
And I'm here because there's you.
They say I'll never see your face
And we're out there from your grace,
The one you fashioned with your hand,
And scattered all across the land,
But I am happy just to know
That you must go
Where I must go
For there are winds and scars to show
Livin' here down here below...
Down here below,
The setting sun is shining
On the melancholy mood.
I hear the distant thunder
And the crying of the blue
Down where below 
I'm yours alone
The only one to call my own
The only one I've ever known
Sometimes I see you
Standing there
Sometimes I'm freer.
And you are here,
Down here with me,
You made me just the way a hear,
Or less feeling, eyes to see
A strange embrace, a simple hand,
A spirit free that says: "I can",
And I'm happy just to know
That you will go
Where I must go,
For you send me this I know
Living here, down here below,
Living here, down here below,
Living here, down here below.
