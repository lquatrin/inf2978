Often I sing when I'm all alone,
And no one can see me but me.
I think and wonder what I am
And how I came to be.
I can swim the ocean,
And it's deep and wide,
And in the house above me
Abide.
Maybe one day I'll fly like an eagle,
Fly like a bird and go and go.
Soar like an eagle,
Walk like a lion,
Although it won't be I know.
But I can swim the ocean,
And it's deep and wide,
And in the house above me
Abide.
I guess the time has come for me to go.
And look around for something, oh,
Just moving in my house you know.
Moving slowly is not really bad,
Moving slowly you see
The wonders of the deep,
Just waiting there for me.
And I can swim the ocean,
And it's deep and wide,
And in the house above me
Abide.
And in the house above me
Abide...
