Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on a drum
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
Elegant boy, beautifil girl
Dancing for joy elegant whirl
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway, then slip away
To some secluded place
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
Whispering trees, echo their sighs
Passionate pleas, tender replies
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
Lovers in flight upward they glide
Burst at the height slowly subside
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream for two for you and me
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night afro blue
