The music is the magic of a secret world
Secret world, a secret world
It's a world that is always within
The music is the magic and the hiding place
The hiding place, the hiding place
The music is the magic and the hiding place
It's a place where the spirit is home
The music is the magic of a sacred world
Sacred world, a sacred world
The music is the magic of a sacred world
It's a world that is always within
The music is the magic through a raging storm
A raging storm, raging storm
The music is the magic through the raging storm
The storm that is over again
The music is the magic of a sacred world
Sacred world, a sacred world
The music is the magic of a sacred world
It's a world that is always within
