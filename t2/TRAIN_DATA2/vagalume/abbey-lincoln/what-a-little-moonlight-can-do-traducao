Ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do for you
You're in love
Your heart's aflutter
All day long you only stutter cause your poor tongue
Just will not utter the words
'I love you'
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You'll get bold
Can't resist him
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
