A small boy walked down a street city
And hope was in hes eyes
As he searched the faces of people he'd meet
For one he could recognized
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around him.
Looking for a soul brother all around him.)
The eyes of people who passed him by
Were cold and as hard as stone
The poor boy whimpered and began to cry
Because he was all alone
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
(Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him.)
Now there are many who swear it's true
That brothers all we are
Yet it seems there are very few
Who will answer a brother's call
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(They said you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(said you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(I know you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(Oh, you came this way, I know you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
