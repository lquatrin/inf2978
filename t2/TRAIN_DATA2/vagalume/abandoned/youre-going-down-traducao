My friend this time you've gone too far
Can't stand the shit you put me through anymore
The blow won't even see it coming
The fear it's gonna send you running
This time you're going down for good
[Bridge:]
Now it's clear tension grows
Feel the pain fell the blow
Take a chance roll the dice
Disgust in my eyes
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna bring you down
You're gonna be kissing the ground
A broken shell of a man
Your hide is mine!
My past soiled by the things you've done to me
I cast a shadow you will have to see
My grip is tightening araound you
I step on everything dear to you
I guess this is it for you
[Bridge:]
Now it's clear tension grows
Feel the pain fell the blow
Take a chance roll the dice
Disgust in my eyes
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna bring you down
You're gonna be kissing the ground
A broken shell of a man
Your hide is mine!
I dream in retrospect to all this shit
I wish I hadn't done the things I did
Blood soiled my hands, regret is with me
What's done is done, no way that I see
To turn back to a better time
[Bridge:]
Now it's clear tension grows
Feel the pain fell the blow
Take a chance roll the dice
Disgust in my eyes
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna bring you down
You're gonna be kissing the ground
A broken shell of a man
Your hide is mine!
