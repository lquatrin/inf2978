At the Office Xmas Party I met my fate
Under the snowflakes hanging shared a cigarette
The xmas lights were blinking I felt so sure
The decorations over office furniture
But it's not cool to be with you
because we know they set the rules
Larry's in antlers and he always gets so drunk
We watched and laughed as his red nose went in the punch
But it's not cool to be with you
Although I really would like to
And the lights were shimmering, and the room was spinning
Are we going too far?
We're walking back to your car
At the Office Xmas Party I met my fate
Driving to work on Monday sad and running late
But it's not cool to be with you
I see you in the copy room
Yeah it's not cool to be with you
The office talk can be so cruel.
