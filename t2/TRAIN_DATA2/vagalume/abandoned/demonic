I - I am the God of lies I speak to you in dreams
My vanishing disguise is not just what it seems
You - You'll never understand the power of my hate
So better leave this path before it is too late
[Chorus:]
Don't you ever call my name don't you invoke me
You will never be the same when I am set free
Just call my name and you will see it's now or never
Your soul soon belongs to me
You'll burn forever
I - I rule the world's demise you don't know what I am
With fire in my eyes I do the worst I can
[Chorus:]
Don't you ever call my name don't you invoke me
You will never be the same when I am set free
Just call my name and you will see it's now or never
Your soul soon belongs to me
You'll burn forever
I - I am the God of lies I speak to you in dreams
My vanishing disguise is not just what it seems
My - my evil took its way my powers concentrate
Now I am here to stay to rule this world in hate
[Chorus:]
Don't you ever call my name don't you invoke me
You will never be the same when I am set free
Just call my name and you will see it's now or never
Your soul now belongs to me
You'll burn forever
Hahahahahahahahaha in hell !
