All you've ever known all you ever learned
Was paying with money you never earned
You are so self-absorbed you are so vain
You can't buy love because
No pain, no gain
I can't bear to witness your self-important kind
Everyone just turns away you must be blind
Come hell or high water you try to prevail
Have you ever considered that you might fail?
[Chorus:]
Pulling out your purse not knowing
Money's worth you try to save your soul
So pay the dues for all
Try to save your soul pay the dues for all
Try to save your soul pay the fuckin' dues for all
Have you ever questioned your point of view?
Have you ever challenged the things you do?
No one really needs you no one really cares
No one really loves you
No one ever dares, no!
[Chorus:]
Pulling out your purse not knowing
Money's worth you try to save your soul
So pay the dues for all
Pay the dues !
