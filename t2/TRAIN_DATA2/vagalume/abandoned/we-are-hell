In this world we're living in
We have to bear the pain
Every day ten thousands die
Strangled, stabbed and slain
This must be hell!
Men are killed on Tv screens
Entertaining masses
Marching out to holy wars
Will never save our asses
Godforsaken armies spilling blood
Mutilated bodies in the mud
All the big religions try
To take away our fears
Transcending to another life
When the end is near
This must be hell!
If there's a god that cares for us
Why can't he see?
Suffering each day by day
Doesn't make sense to me!
Our world one of a kind
Open eyes but we are blind
We're alive but not so well
Could it be that this is hell?
This must be hell!
We are in hell!
