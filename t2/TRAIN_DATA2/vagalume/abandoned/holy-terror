Like raging fire my mission is defined
To suppress desire To make them mine
But what is all the pain for And all the lies
For all I bring to mankind Is evil in desguise
[Bridge:]
Holy father can't you see
The doubt and strife that live in me
The chosen one I used to be
Can't hide from reality
[Chorus:]
Rip the demons from my heart
Bring me back to the start
I am corrupted by evil summoning
This war I started it doth bring
The flames and screams are haunting me
My actions seem surreal
Make them praise your glory
What a deal !
[Bridge:]
Holu father can't you see the doubt and strife that live in me
The chosen one I used to be Can't hide from reality
[Chorus:]
Rip the demons from my heart
Bring me back to the start
[Bridge:]
Holy father can't you see
The doubt and strife that live in me
The chosen that I am still
The given way I can't fulfill
[Chorus:]
Rip the demons from my heart
Bring me back to the start
