The years passed byi wonder why
How we came to this
You make me sweat You make me writhe
You hypnotize me with shut eyes
The less I care the more we share
In this dirty little game
And when I'm gone this game I've won
There's no one left to blame
[Bridge:]
Why don't you take this spell from me?
With evil eyes you look at me
This cant' be our destiny
Why don't you
[Chorus:]
Take this spell from me
When we can't get it right
Take this spell from me
When our worlds collide
Give me some dynamite and hold me tight
To bring it to an end Ill sign the book of condolence
Dedicated to our romance this love means war
The vultures soar above our desecrated souls
And when they lately feast on me
Finally you set me free
[Bridge:]
Why don't you take this spell from me?
With evil eyes you look at me
This cant' be our destiny
Why don't you
[Chorus:]
Take this spell from me
When we can't get it right
Take this spell from me
When our worlds collide
