Going fast - living on the edge
Adrenaline - give my life in pledge
Thunder - roaring down the street
Gasoline - gives me what I need
[Chorus:]
And as my wheels keep turning
And as my enginge's burning
There's no place'd rather be
Hell is home for me
Overdrive - speed up to the limit
Way of life - stake your claim and hold it
Burning out - reach the final goal
Wearing out - losing all control
[Chorus:]
And as my wheels keep turning
And as my enginge's burning
There's no place'd rather be
Hell is home for me
Shifting gear - getting even faster
Hit the road - here I know no masters
Crank it up - shifting even higher
Speed of sound - sets my heart on fire
[Chorus:]
And as my wheels keep turning
And as my enginge's burning
There's no place'd rather be
Hell is home for me
