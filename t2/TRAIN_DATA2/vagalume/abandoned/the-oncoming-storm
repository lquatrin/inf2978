In the distance, dark shades of gray
Drawing near, destruction's on its way
Darkness falls, blackness fills the sky
From above, evil forces ally
Thunder roaring, whirlwinds rape the land
Panic rises, mandkind will repent
Rising tide, raging storm from hell
Horrific sight no one can tell
[Bridge:]
Taking the lies of the innocent
The wrath of god comes down
Cleansing the world of the vermin beed
Everything must drown
Now!
[Chorus:]
There's an oncoming storm
It's the end of the world
[Spoken:]
The plague is pushing forward
All life will decease
Ineverate fanatics
Falling to their knees
100 days of fear and death
The storm is raging on
Devastated planet earth
Now His will is done
In the end all came to rest
Trail of terror, nothing is left
The dead deprived of their souls
The stomr has taken its toll
[]Bridge:
Taking the lies of the innocent
The wrath of god comes down
Cleansing the world of the vermin beed
Everything must drown
Now!
[Chorus:]
There's an oncoming storm
It's the end of the world
There's an oncoming storm
Armageddon is here!
