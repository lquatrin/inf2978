Can you hear me calling out your name?
I'm the one who's lurking in the dark
You can't tell what I am but I am there
From now on I'm haunting your every dream
I'm trapped between the worlds
A traveller in time
Caught in the twillight
I am the last in line
A long forgotten soul
That's full of hate and sin
The gates of hell are open
But they won't let me in
Let me in!
You think You can handle what you invoked
I'm older then time, I will betray
There's no way out and no letting go
I am chaos and I will prevail'
Trapped between the worlds
