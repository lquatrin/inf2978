Woke up last night and could not breathe
A pain so bad I couldn't believe an antic in the dark I see
My nightmares, they were haunting me
[Bridge:]
I hear myself - screaming
I see myself - killing
I walk along a darkened floor
My lust for you is growing more
And as I hear your voice I see
There is no other choice for me
I have to taste your sweet warm blood
A dark desire, red and hot
As luscious as a dream can be
A love beyond reality
[Bridge:]
I hear myself - screaming
I see myself - killing
My blood is freezing in my veins
I see you dead, your icecold face
And no one takes away my sins
As I feast on you with a grin
[Chorus:]
A nightmare's coming true
[Bridge:]
I hear myself - screaming
I see myself - killing
No one ever pardons me
And all hell is after me
The nightmares that were haunting me
Have now become reality
[Chorus:]
A nightmare's coming true
