Bombs explode fires flare
Bullets fly, devil's stare
Smell of fear, all around
Filled with terror, blackened ground
How it happened, no one knows
Seeds of hatred, someone sowed
Grow in terror, bloom in fear
Crop of madness, Harvest's here
[Chorus:]
The evil light of a man-created sun
Engulfs the world Forbidden blaze
Winds of Change What have we done?
A crime against god's creation
His will undone
The chosen on he weeps
Return to one
The race is run, the damage done
Tears we shed, we doed as one
Few are left, hope for death
Final blow, final breath
No more pain, no more fear
Relieved from life, end is here
Clean the slate, start anew
Lord, thy will upon us do
[Chorus:]
The evil light of a man-created sun
Engulfs the world Forbidden blaze
Winds of Change What have we done?
A crime against god's creation
His will undone
The chosen on he weeps
Return to one
Pain, starvation everywhere
Violence is in the air
Parents watch their childrem die
Men, they weep, women cry
Innocence, torn to shreds
New born day, new born threats
Unsung heroes, dead and slain
Died alone, Died in vain
[Chorus:]
The evil light of a man-created sun
Engulfs the world Forbidden blaze
Winds of Change What have we done?
A crime against god's creation
His will undone
The chosen on he weeps
Return to one
