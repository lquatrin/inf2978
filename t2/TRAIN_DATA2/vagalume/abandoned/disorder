Some say I betray and lie
Yes, they are right! Ha Ha!
I like to turn the world around
With main and might
Evil is my nature
Confusion is my game
I live my life in chaos
Disorder is my name
I am hungry for some violence
I'm thirsty for some blood
You gotta make my day
'Cos this is all I've got
I'm insane!
Give me what you have got
A sweet caress
At first I'll smile and then I'm gonna
Kick your ass
When I am in good humour
I leave a trail of fear
I set the world on fire
And then I disappear
No one stands in my way
I'll stay my course
Yes, I'm bad, insane, and mad
No remorse
No remorse, I'm insane!
