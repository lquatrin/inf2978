Since the olden days
We try to figure out
What we are living for
What it's all about
No one ever found an answer
No one really knows
The search for meaning
On and on it goes
Time is sleeping through my hand
Incapable to understand
No!
Sands of time
Running through our hands
Sands of time
Centuryies are passing by
Sands of time
Where are we from?
Where do we go?
Sands of time
The harder we keep searching
The more questions we find
As time is passing by
We don't know our own kind
Forgotten knowledge
Ancient history
May give the answer
But we're too blind to see
