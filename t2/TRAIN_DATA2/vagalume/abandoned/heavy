I've gotta say that you and me are heavy
Oh, its so heavy we're going real steady
It's you and me babe driving in a Chevy
Oh its so heavy we're going real steady
And when the fire begins to dim
Not knowing how it all will end
Theres something else to take its place
The heaviness is all erased
And when I feel it starts to fall
I think of how we get along
And all the things that we can be because you bring me levity
I've gotta say that you and me are heavy
Oh it's so heavy do you think we're really ready?
And when when the fire begins to dim
Not knowing how it all will end
Theres something else to take its place
The heaviness is all erased
And when I feel it start to fall
I think of how we get along
And all the things that we can be
Because you bring me levity
Like a mountain, skyscraper
Its heavy, it's heavy
Like words drawn on a paper
Its heavy, it's heavy
