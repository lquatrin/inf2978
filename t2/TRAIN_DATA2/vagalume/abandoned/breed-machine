In a distant future
Mankind has no fate No birth, no father, mother
No sex, no love, no hate
Engineering children
Student chemically to get rid of the scum
Threading you and me
[Bridge:]
No one knows the truth
About the cradle of all youth
[Chorus:]
It's the breed machine
Growing life in factories
Breed machine
Restricted abilities
Breed machine
Keeping life in check
Breed machine
There's no turning back
Predetermined destiny environmental hell
Savage reservations where the outcasts dwell
Blind trust in society making people numb
Loss of all emotions making people dumb
[Bridge:]
No one knows the truth
About the cradle of all youth
[Chorus:]
It's the breed machine
Growing life in factories
Breed machine
Restricted abilities
Breed machine
Keeping life in check
Breed machine
There's no turning back
For mankind
