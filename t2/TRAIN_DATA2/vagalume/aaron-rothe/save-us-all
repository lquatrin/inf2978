I don't need a lot, I'm a simple man, a simple man,
and all I am is what you see,
and there's no secrets hidden in my walls.
All I did was believe, that love can save us all,
and some will rise and others fall,
but, if we all stand tall,
Love will save us all,
It'll save us all. 
It's hard to give yourself, when there's not much there for you to share.
and maybe you've been hurt before.
You're not alone, you're not the only one that finds that pain hard to ignore. 
Families fall apart, and one more ends and other starts.
but if we do our part, love could save our hearts,
could save us all, (x5) 
Save us All. (x15) 
Love will save us all,
and some will rise and others fall.
If we all stand tall,
Love will save us all.
