I've questioned love
Taken advice
I've let my gaurd down more than twice
I'm running on empty
Come to me
I know your better than what I had dreamed
A girl that I will love
I'm coming to find you
I just can't wait to sweep you off your feet
I wonder who you are and where I'll find you
I can't wait until we meet
Does she work
And will she sing
I wonder what her name will be
I'm lying here I pray my soul to keep
I wonder what your dad will think of me
A girl that I will love
I'm coming to find you
I just can't wait to sweep you off your feet
I wonder who you are and where I'll find you
I can't wait until we meet
There's one for me somewhere in this world
Come to me my darling girl
I'm waiting for you to share your life with me
One day you'll be mine, mine, mine
A girl that I will love
I'm coming to find you
I just can't wait to sweep you off your feet
I wonder who you are and where I'll find you
I can't wait until we meet
(Ahhhhh, Ahhhh, Ahhh, Ahhh, Ohhhhh,
Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh, Ahhhohhhhhh)
A girl that I will love
I'm waiting for you
I just can't wait to sing my songs to you
I can't wait to lose my breath when I see you
I hope you're waiting for me too
And I hope you're waiting for me too
Probably haven't met you but I'm singing to you
I couldn't wait to write a song for you
Woo!
