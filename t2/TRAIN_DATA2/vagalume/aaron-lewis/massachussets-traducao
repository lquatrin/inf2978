I sit here on the stairs and listen to
The nighttime as the daylight fades away
Such a haunting and familiar tune
And when i hear it in the distance i can say
That i'm home, in massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where i always am, it's where i long to be
Because i'm home
The north shore is where my father lives
I wear my red sox hat around the world with pride
But the berkshires are where my heart is
And when i see them in the distance i could cry
Because i'm home, in massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where i always am, it's where i long to be
Nyla started preschool and indie just turned two
And zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older and time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry
So i just pass the sign that welcomes me to worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasn't really changed with time
The way this country that i love it used to be
Because i'm home, in massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where i always am, it's where i long to be
Because i'm home, in massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes every day
And where my friends don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where i'll always stay
Because i'm home
