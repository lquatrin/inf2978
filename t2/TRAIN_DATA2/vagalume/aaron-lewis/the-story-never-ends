Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
And the maples on this road they must be 300 years old
Just imagine all the stories they could tell
Of the tractors and the cars all coming home from Liston's bar
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
To raise some hell
And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
So I just hit ground and keep on running
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try and pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way they did belong
Well the next thing that you know
It's time to play another show
I'm leaving out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
When you are gone
And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my Amendment rights keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my Amendment rights keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
Where the story never ends
Another two months and the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
