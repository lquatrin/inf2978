Well I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My Pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks
back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker back in the day he put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man
and the whiskeys known to change the man
That's not me
I rarely drink from a bottle
But I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go in a town of
1200 off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
Now it's been 12 years since I've sold my soul to the devil in L. A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line
and your songs they all will play
He set up shot on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said you want to sell a million records boy
you better listen to me
He said change your style, whiten your smile
you could lose a couple pounds
if you want to live this life you better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?
I said
No that's not me
'CauseThe biggest things in life are my friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t shirt
and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my 9 or 45
I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
My idea of heaven is chasing white tail bucks
And as a country boy, you know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land and they really sum up how
I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The Red, The White, The Blue
The other ones got a rattle snake with a simple statement made
Don't Tread on Me is what it says and I'll take that to my grave
Because this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
'Cause i never needed Government to hold my hand
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
'Cause my family's always fight and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
