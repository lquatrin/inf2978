You know you’re past
A mid-way mark
Yeah it’s too late
To turn back
Tomorrow will be
Clean of this day
Don’t worry so much
You will find your way
And you wish it would rain
Cos you’re thirsty again
But it won’t hurt a bit
Like a kiss on your lips
Take a bite, here’s a light
There’s a hole in the night
Just go through
It’s for you
It’ll be alright
There’s still time
If we run
Some reasons are
Best forgotten
The night won’t wait forever
It keeps getting better
And better
Hold me close
Pull me near
There is nothing to fear
Let it go
Like a song
Cos the frost is all gone
There’s a light in your eyes
You can drop your disguise
Cos you’re so brand new
And there’s so much loving to do
Look at you now
You’re high as a kite
Head full of stars you are
Traveling light
You’re on your own
But you’re not alone
If you look around
You will find you are home
And you wish it would rain
Cos you’re thirsty again
But it won’t hurt a bit
Like a kiss on your lips
Take a bite, here’s a light
There’s a hole in the night
Just go through
It’s for you
It’ll be alright
Hold me close
Pull me near
There is nothing to fear
Let it go
Like a song
Cos the frost is all gone
There’s a light in your eyes
You can drop your disguise
Cos you’re so brand new
And there’s so much loving to do
There’s so much loving to do
There’s so much loving to do
There’s so much loving to do
