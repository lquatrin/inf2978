I’ve been running into trouble
Well mostly I’ve been walking
Having conversations with God
Where I do all the talking
Just to find the will to live
Is a search that takes me far and wide
Sometimes the suburbs of paradise
Leave a lot to be desired
Will I rise, will I rise up?
Will I rise, will I rise, up?
As I crawl around my house
I think I could just disappear
I keep looking in the mirror
Just to see if I’m still here
Maybe we could overthrow
The political campaign
With all this blood on our hands
We’ve only got ourselves to blame
Will we rise, will we rise up?
Will we rise, will we rise up?
Will we rise... up?
Will we rise... up?
The road ahead is all the shiver
But is the past through with me yet?
All the sins of the father
That I’m trying to forget
Why’s it take a world of love
To let just a little in
There’s a murmur in my heart
But it might be only spring
Will it rise, will it rise up?
Will it rise, will it rise up?
Will we rise... up?
Will we rise, will we rise up?
Will we rise... up...?
