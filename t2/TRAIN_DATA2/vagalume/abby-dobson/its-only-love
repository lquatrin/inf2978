Ba ba do dab a dab a do, oh oh...
One false move away from you
I couldn’t leave now if I wanted to
I’m too far gone to turn from you
What are we gonna do?
I was not the type to fall from grace
But I lost my footing when I saw your face
And I’d break every rule I make
Will this be my last mistake?
It’s only love, that I’m seeking
It’s only love, that I’m seeking
I played out this scene a hundred times
But now I look at your mouth and I forget my lines
You draw me in just like a cigarette
One morning dawn with a head full of regret
My life is made up with the things I said I wouldn’t do
Now here I am standing in front of you
It seems there’s only trouble and desire
I’m standing on a wire, I’m sitting in a fire
It’s only love that I’m seeking
It’s only love that I’m seeking
Its only love, its only love
I can’t yell any louder
I can’t breathe any deeper
I can’t hold on a little longer
I can’t sing any stronger
I can’t turn it on
I can’t turn it off
I can’t keep this type from rising
I can’t contain this yearning
I can’t stop this fire
One false move away from you
I couldn’t leave now if I wanted to
I’m too far gone to turn from you
What are we gonna do?
Its only love, that I’m seeking
Its only love that I’m seeking
It’s only love, it’s only love
It’s only love that I’m seeking
(ba ba da ba do ba da...)
It’s only love that I’m seeking
Its only love that I’m seeking
Its only love, its only love
Its only love, it’s only love
