What’s the matter baby?
You’ve been crying for too long
You’ve been hiding out in the dark
Trying to work out what went wrong
And I know that it’s not easy
With these monsters in your head
You’ll come around
You will
You can do it
You’ll come around
You will
It’s been weeks now baby
You’ve been locked behind your door
It’s okay to come out
It’s time for you to swim to shore
And I know that it’s not easy
With these sharks around your bed
You’ll come around
You will
You can do it
You’ll come around
You will
Cos you’re free as a bird
You’re free as a bird
You’re free as a bird
As a bird
As a bird
As a bird
As a bird
As a bird
As a bird
What’s the matter baby?
You’ll come around
You will
You can do it
You’ll come around
You will
You’ll come around
You will
There’s nothing to it, oh
You’ll come around
You will
What’s the matter baby?
What’s the matter baby?
What’s the matter baby?
Baby, baby.
