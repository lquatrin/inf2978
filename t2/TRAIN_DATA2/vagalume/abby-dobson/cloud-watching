Would you like to come cloud watching with me?
We can while away the afternoon
Just to step out of time is all we need
Looking out for the other rule
Cos there’s no place
I’d rather be
There’s no one
I’d rather see
Would you like to come cloud watching with me?
We can watch the world roll on by
Dreaming up all the endless possibilities
Staring into the open sky
Cos there’s no place
I’d rather be
And there’s no one
I’d rather see
Watch the blues get blown away
Would you like to come cloud watching with me?
We don’t have to talk at all
If we lie on our backs in the green green grass
I guarantee there’s no way to fall
Cos there’s no place
I’d rather be
And there’s no one
I’d rather see
And together watch the blues get blown away
Cos there are so many clouds in the sky today
Yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah...
