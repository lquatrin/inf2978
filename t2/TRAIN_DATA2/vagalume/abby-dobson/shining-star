You are, you are a shining star
I love you just the way you are
The road’s so fast so you will fall
You know that you’ve already got it all
It doesn’t matter what you do
It doesn’t matter what you say
I will love you
You’re chasing after all the gold, uh oh
But even now your heart is cold, uh oh
To gain the world but lose your soul
Well I don’t need to weigh it up to know
It doesn’t matter what you do
It doesn’t matter what you say
I will love you
It doesn’t matter if you fall
It doesn’t matter if you run away
I will love you
All these lines upon your face
So scared to live without a trace
Tried to outrun the setting sun
But there’s enough for everyone
You could keep digging up china oh
But you would never find it no no
Searching so hard for your happiness
But it’s not where you think it is
It doesn’t matter what you do
It doesn’t matter what you say
I will love you
It doesn’t matter if you fall
It doesn’t matter if you run away
I will love you
It doesn’t matter what you do
It doesn’t matter what you say
Cos I will love you
It doesn’t matter if you fall
Or if you run away
I will love you
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
Ooooooooooooh oh
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
Ooooooooooooh oh
You are, you are, a shining star
You are, you are, a shining star
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
You are, a shining star
A shining star
