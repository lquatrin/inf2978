You’ve got the world at your feet
You’ve got them dancing in the street
You’ve got them wrapped around your fingertips
You never tried to be a star
Cos you were happy where you are
Brighter than the galaxy
You’re jumping over
These four leaf clovers
You’re high like heaven now
And there are locks around your head
A choir of angels round your bed
And when you sleep you fly above this land
You wake with scratches on your feet
But your secret’s safe with me
Cos there are things that they’ll just never understand
You’re jumping over these four leaf clovers
You’re high like heaven now
They want to own you
But they’ve never shown you
A reason to come down
You’re just like a bird
And you fly so high
You break like a child
When you fall from the sky
La la la la, la la la la
And they wanna rescue thee
But there are ropes they cannot see
The gods will never ever lose their grip
Many men have tried before
But felt like soon as they leave shore
They summon seas to sink their pretty ship
But you’re jumping over
These four leaf clovers
You’re high like heaven now
They want to own you
But they’ve never shown you
A reason to come down
They want to own you
But they’ve never shown you
A reason to come down
La la la la, la la la la...
High like...
