(E M A, your love is cold)
You gave me comfort
You broke my chest
When sparks were pouring me on earth
Rode a dragonfly
That I've been
Showed your colors
Left me cold
My love and I broke it
My love and I broke it
E M A, your love is cold
My love and I broke it
My love and I broke it
M I O, I let you go
Ma caught me stealing
You took me in
When fireworks blew off in heat
Drove the empire
That I, I've been
Showed your colors
Left me cold
My love and I broke it
My love and I broke it
E M A, your love is cold
My love and I broke it
My love and I broke it
M I O, I love you so
My love and I broke it
(Your heart will go)
My love and I broke it
(Love is cold)
M I O, I let you go
E M A, your love is cold
My love and I broke it
My love and I broke it
E M A, your love is cold
Get back, hands down, get back
E M A, I love you so
Get back, hands down, get back
E M A, I love you so
