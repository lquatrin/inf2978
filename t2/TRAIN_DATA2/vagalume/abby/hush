Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
Go away my demon
Go with me now
Leave your hands in a castle
Burn it down
Be my guidance in the night
Be my friend
Free me on your beating heart
Hush
Children of my sorrow?
Leave your hearts in
You burn them down
Take a lovestain from my heart
Brush it off
Free me on your way to blush
Hush
Hush
Hush
Weiter weiss ich nich
