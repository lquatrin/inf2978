I'd imagine you could see
A terrible biopic in this dream
I only wish that it'd let me be
At night is the only time that i want
Peace
Take me down to where you rest
Let me get my sins off my chest
There's only one thing that you
Need to know
When i grasp you in my arms
I'll destroy your soul
Why must i be this way?
Why must i be this way?
Why can't i just stay?
And be tender to your needs again?
I just need to stay
Why can't i be this way?
