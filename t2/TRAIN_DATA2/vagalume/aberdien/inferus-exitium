Vines and tripwire vanish in static
Their blind outlines drill panic in forever
It’s undefined; what loosens lines that snag extent
Don’t bother looking for the source
Mend the wounded soul
Beneath the dead skin, melody emerges
The beginning of cycles to come have arrived
Shock waves pull me away from all that sits before us
How do i define the way on a path that can split with the will of effort
How do i know?
Paste molted plaster back up on the figure
Repeat, this time it will hold
Perpetuate the plates ascribed with status and secret
I’ll dose a resurgence of lost ideals
Shock waves pull me away from all that sits before us
How do i define the way on a path that can split with the will of effort
How do i know?
What pulls from the inside has been recalled unannounced
Now stuck with the burning inclination to resist
But now there’s nothing opposing

Holding beliefs in sight
What proof is there any of it’s real?
We decide our own limits
Hoping to bend light and see what supports the galaxies
There has to be an end
