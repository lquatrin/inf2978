Standing paper man to fall from winds he knows will pull apart his folds
Drifting out of reach the city forms another blind eye to the fact that life is change and letting go is living the day awaits for chance to split the nerve go headfirst underneath the path we’ve sewn today will this come as just months stuck dressed in time rule out these battlewounds ensure the light still moves throughout and it’s time we figured out what answers show their face i’m chipping away the puzzles that we put to test they teach me i can’t hide behind the walls i’ve known for so long when a wind sweeps me from this home it’s all right now
The clock begins to tick and stops again i’ll try and wait i will try and wait for you to see it’s killing us you’ll try i’ll wait for you to see that it’s driving us away
