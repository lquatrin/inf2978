Lately I've been thinking about the days I used to know
What happened to the simple times
Things have changed so silently
I yearn for years ago: for things to be just simple again
What happened to the summer nights of yesterday
We've come so far
Wating so quitely I just keep my hands at my sides now
Sunsets chasing summer days into the unknown
Days go by we hardly knew what lay ahead of us
Now it's gone
The best days of my life have passed me by
It seems I'm halfway there
29 south just won't feel the same again
My life has changed and people change
But does that mean we have to age?
And every time I drive down these old roads I'll think of us
So young and worry free right now, I'd hold it there forever
Take it all away before these nights are even here to stay
Coinside with future lies
I'd give it up for one more day
And I don't know what it's like to feel the same anymore
I've fallen down
The months go by, everything stops dead
I'm falling hard without you
And I fall
