Instead of molding eyes
Take a chance on unknown odds
Facing adjacent to wind means coming out inside
Ten poles pass me on the road at test speeds
I don’t understand consistency
(we were made with resistance capabilities)
Now we’re racing autumn’s climb
Onward despite the things that i’ve found
I know now that you can’t put a cap on a bursting valve
Ever think we would be so deep inside
With nowhere left to go?
Goodbye, i am leaving for good
On my way back to where i belong
So instead of holding on
I’ll learn to finally let go
Complacent and facing within
I’m coming out inside
Ten poles pass me on the road
I don’t think
I finally feel consistency
But now we’re back on autumn’s time
Ever think we would be so deep inside
With nowhere left to go?
Goodbye, i am leaving for good
On my way to a home i’ve never been
But i know the way somehow
So long, we’re inactive together but in love alone
