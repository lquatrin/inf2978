Every moment spent without you tears me apart inside
And every skyline spend alone
Brings me right back to the start
Thinking about how we could run so far from what's in front of us
How later I could act cool and win you over
Just like he always does
But that's not me, i could never be
The one that steals your heart
It will never end as I'm stuck to spend eternity alone
Trust in me, take my hand believe that you're everything to me
If this could be, then I would sing tonight what a dream this would be
(Repeat)
My mind's escaping
Your last words elude my everything
And as I'm dancing under these broken suburb skies
I'll think of you and how things could never be
I'm giving up this time and I'm giving up on you
My unrequited soul is falling
