Getting twice as hard it seems to go on this time
Alone with you one million miles away
I think i'm really lost this time
Now it's time to say goodbye
Have i lost it all or was it even here?
And broken hearts will have to
Mend themselves this time around
Like i ever wanted anything to be this way
Like i never wanted you
All the time i've waited here for you to return has been the
Longest days of all my life
And will you still feel the same way now?
Never thought that it would be so close yet distant now
A day too near never seemed this long before
Waste of time trying to breath, my chest is open now
I'm waiting for the time that i can scream
Break it down just when i build it up
Let's try not to get the best of me
