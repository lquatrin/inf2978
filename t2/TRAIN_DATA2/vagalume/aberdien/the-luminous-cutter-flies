Jumbled resize crumbles peelings of dreams at the gate
Forced out, i'm begging strangers to let me starve on
The sound of my love
The gulls fake their cries; false remissions from
Feeling decay
Drawn out, we're betting death's speed won't carve its
Mark in the scope of silence
It's not what we wanted but all that we needed to
Stall at the line
Pacing when spinning wolds collide
Because i'm blind from absolution
I've fallen through the floor and see that the chase
Is enough
Cause as we step through those gates and run past the
Guards
Everything imaginable procreates at the speed of light
Transfixed on enervating the vitality of inertia
I can count on the lights for beating steadily
The only chance is consistency
It's not what we thought but its coming in even though
We left the line
Pacing as spinning worlds align
And when we step through the gates and run past the
Guards
Everything imaginable will unfold at the sight of life
