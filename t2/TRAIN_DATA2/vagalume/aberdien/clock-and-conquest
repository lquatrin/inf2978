Head in tact, i raise the back of my curved spine
And shape its form again
Cause now the seams begin to twitch
And heighten their relentless loss to another
A growling blight takes in breath with older eyes
How did i get here?
I’ve seen growing up is growing wide
And we have to escape it somehow
If only i’d known on some other level that we’d stay
In stone casts of youth in our heyday
I’d thwart this clock and conquest by sending off
Crawl to troughs of blue sand
Sucked with lighters to the gas tank filling with oxygen
From faces pressed, edging divine
It mixes with flames but we won’t be alive
