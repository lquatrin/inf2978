When it comes time do you know how to find
what you're looking for?
Seems as though we've been down this road
at least one time before
But I know now that it's too late for me to understand
what I have lost
Well my loneliness will just have to suffice
Will have to suffice

Seems as though we've been down this road

But I know now that it's too late for me to understand
what I have lost
Well my loneliness will just have to suffice
Will have to suffice for now
Cause I know that it's too late for me to understand
what I have lost
Well my loneliness will just have to suffice for now
For now
