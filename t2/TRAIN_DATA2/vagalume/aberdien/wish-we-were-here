Unsaid moments we lost
Waiting for another day precluding all that sets us free
Another day goes wasted, another night goes by
I'm waiting for the time to walk away
Forgotten how to tell you anything
This complacent feeling
Of lonliness has got to bring a new day fill with understanding lies
I'll hold my breath and close my eyes
Until i find my way back now
I guess i'll have to walk this way all by myself
I guess i'll have to walk this way alone
