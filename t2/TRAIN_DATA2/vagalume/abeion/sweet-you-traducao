Its just you
Sweet you
Dont be scared now
Just listen
Chorus
You never though i would love you so much
You always though i was at your brothers hut
You never listen when i told you im in love
You would always say i dont care you little slut
But the one i loved with all my heart was you (it was you)
Repeat chorus
