There's a clash
Between you and me
Our signs must be altogether different
You and I on top of the world
Looking down to see just where we fit
You and I staring at the city lights
Wondering just where our place is
Broken hearts
Broken arrows
We fall somewhere between
What we want
What we need
And the way it should be
Through the space that exists here between you and me
