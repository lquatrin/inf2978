Clouds and darkness surround 
him righteousness and justice are 
the foundation of his throne. 
A fire goes before him, 
and burns up his enemis on every side . 
his lightnings light the world, the earth see and trembles. 
The mountains melt like wax at the 
presence of the Lord at the presence of 
the Lord of whole earth . 
the heaven declare his righteousness, 
and all be put to shame who serve carved images. 
Who boast of idols . 
whorship him all you gods. 
You who love the Lord hate evil! 
He preserves the souls of his saints .
He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. 
Light is swon for the righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holy Name, our God comes and not be silent. 
A fire devorours before Him, and around him a tempest rages. 
This is God, our God forever and ever, 
he will be our guide even to death. 
(Ps.97.;50)
