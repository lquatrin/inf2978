Going down my mind
To the land beyond the night
Stars they shine like eyes
Then fade from view
Going down my mind
Forever falling
Winding tunnel descending
Spirits they guide my path
As I arrive at a doorway
Entranced I step right through
Many-coloured room
Yellow wall of air
Red wall of fire
Water's blue wall
Green wall of earth
Golden light shining
Elemental realms I travel
Speaking with elemental kings
Secrets of matter I learn
Wisdom hidden I gain
Symmetrical lands
Geometrical angels
A sense of meaning
Of the numinous
Enochian chants
Vast choirs singing
Winding tunnel ascending
Bringing me back to the world
Into my body I return
My newfound wisdom to use
Land beyond the night
