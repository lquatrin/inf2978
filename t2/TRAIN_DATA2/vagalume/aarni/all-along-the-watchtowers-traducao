"All Along The Watchtowers"
Arise, slimy things made of dust; bring forth your knowledge to the Earth!
Voices of wonder, vomit out scorpions' heads
Move and appear, descend; apply yourselves to us!
Come, appear to the terror of the Earth and to our wrath
Arise, say I, and appear!
The rotten, arise!
Include us as receivers of the everlasting flowers of unspeakable pleasure
The works of Man and his pomp, let them be defaced!
The horns of death, arise!
Whose wings are living lamps and seething diamonds
The fay host
Doing what Christ did in Hell
The fay host
Come forth, Tahaoeloj, and bring down the Eastern Watchtower with wind
Come forth, Ohooahaatan, and burn the Southern Watchtower with flame
Come forth, Thahebyobeeatan, and sink the Western Watchtower with water
Come forth, Thahaaotahe, and destroy the Northern Watchtower with earthquake
The fay host
Thunders
The fay host
