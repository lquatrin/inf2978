Five hundred years has gone since I summoned thee,
I learnt all thy lore and made everyone worship me.
The Picatrix of Dee, which thou didst give to me,
Made me grow tentacles and helped me conquer eternity.
The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise,
Bring about your glory and our imminent demise,
The Black Keyes of yore rising from the sea,
Give me true power as promised by Johnny Dee!
Now thou art dead, yet I live forevermore.
I became the shoggoth-master and Deep Ones hold me in awe.
'Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest',
Paracelsus stands by my side because I resurrected him.
The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise,
Bring about your glory and our imminent demise,
The Black Keyes of yore rising from the sea,
Give me true power as promised by Johnny Dee!
'O spiritus Itnaal et Cthulhu! Accipite sacrificium ut
nihil contra me et contra clavem nigrem valeat sera ubi ista clavis ponetur.'
The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise!
'Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest'.
