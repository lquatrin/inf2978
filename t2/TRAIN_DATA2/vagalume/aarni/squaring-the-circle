The first matter,
The salt of salts,
Celestial water dissolves
The subtlest fluid sustains
The burning of sulphur.
Squaring the circle,
Spirit and matter
Driving the triumphal charlot,
Scattering treasures for the world
Blackening to become whitened,
Transmutation accomplished.
Squaring the circle,
Zero equals two
Aliquem alium intermum, quadratura circuli
The blood of the lion, the eagle's tears,
Result in the stone of millions of years.
Squaring the circle, solve et coagula
Omne superius sicut inferius
