If I was a painter I'd throw away my brush
And if I was a fighter I'd hang up my gloves
And if I was a magician I'd give away my secrets
If I was the only witness I'd swear to forget
See I'd give it all up to go back to before I fell in love
To the first time that I saw your pretty face
And turn and walk away
If I was the night sky I'd give away my stars
And if I was the sunshine I would gladly go dark
If I was king of the jungle I would give up my throne
If I was Cesar Augustus I would surrender Rome
See I'd give it all up to go back to before I fell in love
To the first time that I saw your pretty face
And turn and walk away
Should've walked away (x4)
Could've walked away (x2)
Should've walked away
Could've walked away
Shouldn't let it get that far
Now I am all torn apart
How I wish I could erase you
See I'd give it all up to go back to before I fell in love
To the first time that I saw your pretty face
And turn and walk away
