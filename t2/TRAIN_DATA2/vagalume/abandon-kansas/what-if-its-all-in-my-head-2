You have made us to be like you
Now we've made you one of us
And we've locked you inside this box called our minds
We're so confused
I've been thinking about the things I think I know
I won't know for sure until I'm home
What if it's all in my head?
There's a field of peace way out beyond
What I thought was right and you thought was wrong
I'll meet you there and together we'll find truth
I've been thinking about the things I'll tell my son
And I'm not sure if I should be the one
