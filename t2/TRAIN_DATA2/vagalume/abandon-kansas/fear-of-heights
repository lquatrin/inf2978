Convictions as strong as they are it's over when I exhale
Could I sing if know one heard me?
Would I pray if no one asked me to?
Could I love if no one loved?
We fly, we fly on the wings of love tonight
On the wings of love tonight
To know that You're still in control
And I'm right where I belong
I've been here along
On the wings of love
How can I fly when I wasn't given wings
All You gave me was fear of heights
But if something doesn't change now
If things keep going on this way
I'll run away
