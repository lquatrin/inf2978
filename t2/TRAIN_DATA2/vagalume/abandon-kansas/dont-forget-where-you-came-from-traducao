Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
Watch as the painting
Turn on the painter
I'll do pain it by number
Watch as the clay
Turns on the potter
I'll do it my on way
My heart's gettin harder
Don't forget where you came from
When you're lookin ahead
Tell me the story
I need to hear it again
The one where we're truly helpless
From beginning to end
Don't forget where you came from
You have yo be lost
Before you're found and I've been found out
I'm turning myself in now
And I'm so dependent
On keeping my independence
I forgot how
Don't forget where you came from
When you're lookin ahead
Tell me the story
I need to hear it again
The one where we're truly helpless
From beginning to end
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
When they flip through the pages of time
(flip through the pages of time)
And the credit is mine
(the credit is mine)
From point a to point b
(point a to point b)
It could not happen to me
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
When you're lookin ahead
Tell me the story
I need to hear it again
The one where we're truly helpless
From beginning to the end
(don't forget where you came from)
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
