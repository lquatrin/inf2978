These walls are high, much taller than this room
If you want in it's gonna to cost you
Stop right there, that's the closest that you're ever gonna to get
One step more, and I'll make a run for it
But there is something different in your eyes
And I will let you in every single time
You, you, and only you! You make me so brave
You make me want to change my ways
You, you and only you! You make me so strong
From now on, I'm yours
I feel so small like an extra in someone else's scene
And when the credits roll my minor roll won't even make the screen
Then you crack a smile and I forget all about myself
Change my ways
You, you and only you! So strong
I'm yours
