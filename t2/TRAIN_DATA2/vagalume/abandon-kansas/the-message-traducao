By the looks of things, you still have time
But not that much, so savor it
Cause what you want, and what you need
Are different things, but you can't see
That you've lost control of yourself
And you're going to need more outside help
If you're ever going to make a change
Don't you look at me (How could you blame me?)
I believed in the person you used to be (I tried so hard to believe)
But now things have changed (I knew this would happen)
You threw it away (I wanted to help you)
I still believe (with all of my heart) there's hope for you
Did you think that I was going to leave?
After all we've been through, all the things we've seen
You've given up but I'm not giving up on you
My love remains, there's nothing you can do
By the number of messages
0n your phone It looks you
May not be missed if you left
Or if you did not exist
But you do exist for a reason
You're beauitful, He created you
Tonight its time to drop your guard
And finally stop telling lies
We can work this out, it will all be fine
I tell myself this all the time
We can work this out, it will all be fine
I tell myself this all the time
