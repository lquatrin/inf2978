If you're not a liar then convince me otherwise
Look into these eyes and tell me that what you did tonight
Was not intentional
Cause I'm starving for your attention
and I'm begging for your approval
I can only take so much of being number two
So I'll call you again and I'll hope that you pick up this time 
Cause I'm tired of standing here in line
Behind everything that matters to you
It's been awhile since we've spent time alone
You've been trying so hard to impress the people you don't know
Cause you're starving for their attention
And you're begging for their approval
They might say they love you, but tomorrow they'll be gone
So I'll call you again and I'll hope that you pick up this time 
Cause I'm tired of standing here in line 
Behind everything that matters to you
