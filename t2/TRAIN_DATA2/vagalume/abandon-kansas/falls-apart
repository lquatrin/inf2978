I'm no stranger to the way things work out
When you try so hard to make it on your own
And I'm familiar with the way things fall down
When you want it so bad and no one even cares
It falls apart
Everything I built inside my dreams
Falls apart
Crawl across the floor
Picking up the pieces of my heart
I still want to be the best at one thing
Instead of okay at just a few things
And I'm familiar with the way things fall down
When you want it so bad and no one even cares
You told me that you'd meet me there
You told me that I wouldn't follow you
And everything I built inside my dreams seemed to fade away
It takes away my pain
