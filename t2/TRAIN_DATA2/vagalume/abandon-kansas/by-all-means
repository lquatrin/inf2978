In a dream I saw you running back to me in tears
And I was speechless
Very carefully I searched your eyes, those big green eyes
For anything to let me know how you feel
By all means guard your heart, it’s yours to give away
I’m still waiting, I’m still making sure, that this is how the story’s going to end
Even though you appear so strong, I know you’re not
When I awoke from my dream you were gone again
My head was spinning and my lungs caved in
Your words were strong like arms around my chest or rocks falling from your lips
How did three years end like this? Oh no
I’d understand if you need time alone
But you’re not alone
You’re with him
