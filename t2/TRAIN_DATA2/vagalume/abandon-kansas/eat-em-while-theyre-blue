Look at what you did, if they only knew
Who you were on the weekend
And all the guilt and all the pain
And all the lies and all the shame
He can take that away
I just wish I wouldn't try to win this war
And come to you for help, I know you've been through this before
It's times like these we find out who our loved ones really are
And you haven't let me down so far
You don't have to live that way
You don't have to be that man
He can take that away
