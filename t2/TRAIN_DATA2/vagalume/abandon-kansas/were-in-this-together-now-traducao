She asked me if I loved Jesus and does that make you better than me?
A better liar and faker and hider than you, but I'm not better than you
Cause Jesus loved me first, when I was not so lovely
Cause I need grace just as much as you do
Just as much as you do
Cause I make mistakes just as much as you do
Just as much as you do
I'm so poor when it comes to consistency but so rich when it comes to grace
Would you trade this life for anything? I can see the answer's on your face
We're in this together now and I know we'll make it out
