All at once everything has changed, everything is still the same
If you look closer you will find the reasoning behind my efforts to please you
And how they’re aimed at pleasing me
As hard as I try to be perfect
You just need me to be myself
When I told you I was ready I’m not so sure that I thought this whole thing through
But if I hesitate much longer I’ll never move, and I have no more days to lose
I think its time we stop keeping score
And start doing more for the man on the side of the road
Then maybe we will find the reasoning behind the good news that you left us
I’ve kept it all to myself
