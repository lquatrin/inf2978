All this time I was thinking you were mine
You promised me you would never leave
Guess you changed your mind
Whoa, I did not see this coming
Oh no, no, Oh no, Oh no
When did we change, when did we lose it?
Were we in love, or did we confuse it with promises we couldn't keep?
I'm still in love, I know we can do this
But you moved on, you're already through with me
We went from naming our kids to changing your name in my phone
And all the time I spent with you, I spend it alone
Hold on there's so much more to say
Hold on do you really feel this way?
Wait, hold up, there's so much more to say
Wait, hold up, you really feel this way?
