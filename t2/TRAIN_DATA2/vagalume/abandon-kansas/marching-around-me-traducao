If I was a soldier you would give the orders
Tell me what I'm fighting for
If I was a sailor, you would be my captain
You would ship me off to war
When you come around
That's when my flag comes down
And I surrender to you
I'm a captive without a rescue
Your love's an army marching around me
I can't escape this and I don't want to
Your love's an army marching around me
If I was a country you could storm across me
Conquer and divide this land
I can hear your cannons echo through the mountains
Warning me it's my last stand
Oh say can you see what you're doing to me?
Thought I was brave now I'm down on my knees
