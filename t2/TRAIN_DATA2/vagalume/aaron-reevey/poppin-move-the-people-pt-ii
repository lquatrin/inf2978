chorus:
Oh, I got it, got it poppin'
Poppin'
Oh I got it poppin'
Poppin'
And I, I aint stoppin'
Stoppin'
Not for nothing
It'll never happen
Verse 1:
When I walk in the club
I pick my spot
When my song come on
[Move the people]
I get up on the floor
And I do my thing
All eyes shift to me
Why else could it be
Because I,
repeat chorus
Verse 2:
Now that I've got your attention
Why don't you
Show me some affection
None of these other dudes
Can match my dough
I got places to go
Don't you know baby
repeat chorus
I got it poppin everywhere
In the club, at the bar, in the bed
Over here, over there
Hands go up
Drinks go up
Party over here
Party over here
I got it poppin everywhere
In the club, at the bar, in the bed
Over here, over there
Hands go up
Drinks go up
Party over here
Party over here
repeat chorus
