Tried to escape
But your loves so captivating
Tried to decline
But I'm enticed by the look in your eyes
I wish I could walk away
But I can't live a day
Without seeing your face
Eventhough I try to hide
I'm falling
And it's overwhelming me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love take over me
Why must this love
Be so complicated
I tell myself no
But my heart tells me yes
I try to do what's best
But I can't resist
It seems that I'm
Head over heels
Is it real, is it real
What I feel
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love take over me
I try to fight it
I try, I try to fight it
I try to say no
But it's something I cannot do
I try to fight it
I try, I try to fight it
I try to say no
But it's something I cannot do
Won't you please, shower me with your love
(x3)
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love, Take over me
If I were to give into you
Then I would be
Letting love take over me
