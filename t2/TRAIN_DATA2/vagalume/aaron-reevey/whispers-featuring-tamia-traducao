Verse 1: Aaron
I hear you in my sleep
I hear your heart beating
Feel your body next to mine
Keeping me warm everynight
I let you inside my mind
When you tell me the things I long to hear
Forever I wish my dear
That our love will be preserved
I love it when you
chorus: Tamia (Aaron)
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Tell me all the things that I long to hear (Baby when I whisper)
Whisper sweet nothing in my ear
Let me know that you feel the way I do (Girl, do you feel the way that I do)
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Tell me all the things that I long to hear (Baby when I whisper)
Whisper sweet nothing in my ear
Let me know that you feel the way I do (It feels so good)
Verse 2
When I lay myself down at night
I hope for you to bring the heat
And keep me warm
Girl it feels good with you in my arms
It's something I never want to let go of
I hold on to everything
All of your words, baby when you whisper
repeat chorus
bridge: Tamia
Hearing your voice it took me back to the way it should be
Passions so strong it feels like i'm losing my mind
You gotta please forgive me
Yes, so i tripped completely
What can you do
When love gets hold of you
Cause when you went away something so strong
And i didn't know until you were gone (ooh i didn't know)
repeat chorus
Ending: Aaron (Tamia)
You got to whisper in my ear
That you feel the same
(Let me know if you feel the way that I do)
Oh, I feel the way you do
Whisper in my ear
