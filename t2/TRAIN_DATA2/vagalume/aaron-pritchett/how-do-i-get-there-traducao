It's a long, long way from here to you
Tell me how do I get there
There's so much I wish I could undo
Tell me how do I get there
Can a million wrong turns
Ever turn me around
Can I ever unburn
The bridges I burn to the ground
Nowhere's too far
Yea, I'd go anywhere
Tell me how do I get there, from here
Your touch is beyond my fingertips
It lingers in the air
Your heart is where forgiveness is
Tell me how do I get there
Can a million wrong turns
Ever turn me around
Can I ever unburn
The bridges I burn to the ground
Nowhere's too far
Yea, I'd go anywhere
Tell me how do I get there, from here
I'm standing here, asking where to go
With all I am, all i wanna know is
Can a million wrong turns
Ever turn me around
Can I ever unburn
The bridges I burn to the ground
Nowhere's too far
Yea, I'd go anywhere
Tell me how, tell me how
Nowhere's too far
Yea, I'd go anywhere
Tell me how do I get there
Tell me how do I get there
From here
Well, how do I get there
Oh, please tell me now
How do i get there
Oh, tell me now
How do I get there
Tell me
How do i get there
