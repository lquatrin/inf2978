I’m on the 90 heading north
It’s iced up pretty bad
That wind off the lake
Makes it hard to stay on track
There’s a pretty little thing
Brown hair and green eyes
Right now she’s the number one
Thing on my mind
Chorus
If i can stay on this highway
And get there alive
She says that she’ll make it
Well worth my drive
She’s waiting for me
On the other side of all of this snow
Why else would i be
Hell bent for buffalo
There’s a semi in the ditch
There’s flasing lights ahead
But i’m thinking about a fireplace
And nice warm bed
My coffee’s way past cold
All my cigarettes are gone
My knuckles cold and white
From how tight i’m holding on
Chorus
I could turn this rig around
It’s still like summer in the south
But i can see her in my mind
As i throw this hammer down
Chorus
