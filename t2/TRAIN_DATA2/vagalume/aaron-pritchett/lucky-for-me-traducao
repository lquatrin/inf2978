My jaw hit the floor the day you walked in
All eyes were pointed in your direction
With nothin' to lose I asked you to dance
I didn't think that I'd stand a chance but
(chorus)
Lucky for me you proved me wrong (proved me wrong)
It was a roll of the dice
It was a shot so long
What started out as no hope in hell
Has turned out heavenly
A (2 quick strums)
So lucky for me
VERSE
Just goes to show you can't judge a book by the cover
'Cause if I had i'd still be searching for another
I believed I was living in a dream
At any minute somebody'd wake me but
(to chorus)
What started out as no hope in hell
Has turned out heavenly
So lucky for me
