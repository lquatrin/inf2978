Well, I changed my ways to please that woman
But that could never be good enough
I gave up drinkin and I took up churchin’
For a while it wasn’t tough
But barkeep I’ve made a decision
After doing the best I could
That for better or worse
I’m gonna be bad for good
So, bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for talking
Worn every woman around
I’m gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
And for better or worse
I’m gonna be bad for good
I really like my reputation
And how I’m known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
I’m gonna be a tough act to follow
Doin’ what I said I would
And for better or worse
I’m gonna be bad for good
I’m gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
And for better or worse
I’m gonna be bad for good
Yeah, for better or worse
I’m gonna be bad for good
