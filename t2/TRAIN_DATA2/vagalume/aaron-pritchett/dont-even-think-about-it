I was thinking ‘bout the perfect words
To say to that living doll
By the time that I had worked it out
She was half way down the hall
My schoolboy fears of being shot down
Kept that dream from getting off the ground
Lookin back I figured out I thought about it too long
Sometimes you just gotta jump in, get yourself movin’
Countdown the clock is runnin
Sometimes there’s no time to doubt it, just gotta do it
Don’t even think about it
So, baby if it seems I’m coming on too strong
It’s just that I don’t want to feel this feeling gone
Cuz in this moment there could be a golden opportunity
To tell you what you mean to me
Don’t want to think about it too long
