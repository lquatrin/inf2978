Here we are again and you sure look fine
You smile at me and the sparks just fly
I can't understand why this is takin' so long
Somebody must have really done you wrong
Every time I reach for you
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
He hurt you bad and your heart still aches
But why should we pay for his mistakes oh, why
I don't know what he did but he's long gone
He must have really done you wrong
Every time I reach for you
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
Solo
I want to tear down
The walls that you built up
And baby open your heart
To all my love
Every time I reach for you
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really, really
Somebody must have really done you wrong
