I don't think that I should be here anymore
You've watched me pack
And now you're standing by the door
I've gotta strange feeling,
even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're ain't really crying but you're trying
I don't see a single teardrop falling
I've gotta strange feeling,
even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
You don't treat me like you used to
Why don't you come right out
and say we're through
I've gotta strange feeling
Lately you ain't even talking to me
So how come I'm the one feeling guilty
You don't love me like you used to
So come right out and say we're through
I've gotta strange feeling,
even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Hey, I've gotta strange feeling,
even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Hey, I've gotta strange feeling,
even though I'm leaving
That you're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Mmm, when I'm gone,
when I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone
Well, you're not gonna miss me
(when I'm gone)
You're not gonna miss me (when I'm gone)
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
