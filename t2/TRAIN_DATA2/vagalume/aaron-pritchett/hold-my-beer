I've been watching you watchin every girl in the bar
Payin no attention to the one on your arm
You're a dog
Man, she's smokin
I've seen your kind before
and you think you're so cool
This country boy's gonna take you to school
Hold out your hand
no man, I ain't jokin
And hold my beer
While I kiss you're girlfriend
cause she needs a real man
and not a boy like you-ou
hold my beer
yeah I"m a man on a mission
you don't see what you're missin
but I do, so here
hold my beer
well friend I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to fight

but for now

and hold my beer
While I kiss you're girlfriend
cause she needs a real man
and not a boy like you-ou
hold my beer

but I do, so here
