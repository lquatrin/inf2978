I feel like an old guitar
Looking for some brand new strings
Never thought I'd get this far
Without saving anything
For me
Do you still have that smile for me
And could I stay here for a while
I'm looking for a warm safe place
To feel your hand on my face
Let the past roll off of my back
Baby let's not talk about that
I just wanna make it through the night
Lock the door and hide away
I'm looking for a warm safe place
I'm too young to pack it in
I'm too damn old to weather this wind
The rain it just won't stop it seems
And I'm too stubborn to quit these dreams
With you
I can finally find some peace with you
Won't you lay down next to me
I'm looking for a warm safe place
To feel your hand on my face
Let the past roll off of my back
Baby let's not talk about that
I just wanna make it through the night
Lock the door and hide away
I'm looking for a warm safe place
With you
There is shelter from the storm
With you
Come and lay here in my arms
I'm looking for a warm safe place
To feel your hand on my face
Let the past roll off of my back
I don't even wanna talk about that
I just wanna make it through the night
Lock the door and hide away
HIde away
I'm looking for a warm safe place.
