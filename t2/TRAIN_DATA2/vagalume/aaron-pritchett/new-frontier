Wake up baby it’s time to leave
We got plans and we’ve got dreams
We got a long way to go
So pack up all of your emotions
All your faith and devotion
We’re gonna need it, this I know
If you’re at the edge of the past
Our future’s unfolding fast
Baby, don’t look back
We’re going to a new frontier
Wide open without fear I’ll walk this winding road
With you into the great unknown
We’re going to a new frontier
Let’s trust that love will lead us right where we belong
And walk on
I can’t wait to get out of here
The wind is up and the path is near
For the first time in my life
Our destination don’t concern me
More and more I’m longing
It’s the journey, it’s the right
Everything is within our grasp
When we have the courage to ask
And we don’t look back, don’t look back
Chorus
I know there’s no confusion
Where my heart is moving
I know it’s true, I know it’s true
Chorus
And walk on…..
