There's a kind of lovin' that don't take much
It'll leave you colder than a stranger's touch
Some guys will lie late at night
Then they're gone by morning light
Well that ain't my way, baby sure enough
If you look my way you'll find my love
Strong as an oak solid as a pine
It shines like the stars above
My way is moonlit nights
Sunny days and treatin you right
You may have been in love before
But not my way
There's the kind of man knows all the lines
The body language, the zodiac signs
It's a cold cold game and he plays to win
But theres always a loser when that game ends
(Chorus)
(Instrumental break:)
Well you may have been in love before
But not my way (my way)
My way
