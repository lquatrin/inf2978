Things don't always work out like you plan
But you can't let that hold you back from trying again
I've been falling for you, you need not fear
I've got this proposition I think you should hear
Consider this, living life together
Consider this, seeing the world
Consider this, building a home of our own
A front porch, picket fence and three kids
Girl, you and I can't miss Consider this
Every day is a new day, take it as it comes
There's a world out there waiting, seize it and run
You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain
Won't you please consider what my heart has to say
Chorus
Bridge:
We can watch every sunset
Every storm rolling over the shore
Through the good and the bad, girl, we'll have all of that
This could be everything you dreamed of and more
Chorus
