I want so much to cry
And then turn around and hide
Under my tears,away from you
Please try and feel some pride
Show me that you don’t know how
To show me you know
To tell me you love me
Now I’m old enough to know
That this will never be but I don’t care
I want you to know, I’ve always looked
For your secret, tender smile. Let’s say goodnight
The only way that you can show
How you care and how you love
Is to hurt me and hide yourself
Now I’m old enough to know
Years have passed and years will go
But you will never
Open your eyes
