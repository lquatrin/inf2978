It’s been a while
Since I’ve seen you laugh
It’s always just a smile
Instead of tears
I know a place
Where your shadow lives
Lonely, aching in an endless dark
Gone with the wind
Away in a cloud
Gone is my heart
When it feels your grief
The endless books
That describe the end
Or what it was before
And what will be
Well I know a place
Where all shadows live
A place where you and I will someday meet
The ones that exist
Will not cease to exist
And light will prevail
Just believe noone’s gone
