My precious secret
Witches and fairies keep it safe
They take it to a coast
Magical in the moon
Away from earth
Love got dressed like dance
And blew life to my body
And all my steps
I'll get down on my knees
And ask for your fingers
To lay my face
So take me home take me into your arms
Let me see your world
It's in the back of my head
In a picture that's fading
I'll sleep among
The seas and all the stars
Show them how you smile
I'll put my head on your head
And I'll be dancing around you
I only wanna smile
Like I have never ever cried
I only wanna dance
Like I have never ever walked
So take me home take me into your arms
Let me see your world
It's in the back of my head
In a picture that's fading
I'll sleep among
The seas and all the stars
Show them how you dance
I'll put my head on your head
And I'll be dancing around you
