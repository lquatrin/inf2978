Sometimes hearts can be broken
Silly words spoken
Thrown in the air
Sometimes you’re feeling so empty
But something you can’t see
Brings you back to life
Trying to make you feel secure
Releasing my heart’s thoughts
All into you
I’m trying hard to make you see
You’re all I can feel
You’re all that is real
Sometimes there’s no sunshine
There’s no real fight
But I can see
Sonetimes in faraway countries
I’m still dreaming
Please forgive
If you wanna see me fall
Ask and I’ll try
But I’ll never be down
'Caus’ if you only wake me up
But there’s no use
I’m a dreamer
