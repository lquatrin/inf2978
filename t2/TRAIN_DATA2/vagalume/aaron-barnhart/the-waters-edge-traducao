I'm tired of all this sunshine
It makes everything so clear
Thought I'd have it all in no time
Didn't know time would lead me here
Take me down to the waters edge
In your deepest ocean, I can learn to love again
I'll be washed clean by the waves and start again
There's no message in this bottle
Lest not one I care to hear
Why do I need to see the bottom
Before I want to come up for air
Take me down to the waters edge
In your deepest ocean, I can learn to love again
I'll be washed clean beneath the waves and start again, start, we'll start again
I will hear your cry
This time I will not let you fall we'll start again
No need to apologies
I can look into your eyes and start again, we'll start again
Take me down to the waters edge
In your deepest ocean, I can learn to love again
I'll be washed clean beneath the waves and start again, start again
