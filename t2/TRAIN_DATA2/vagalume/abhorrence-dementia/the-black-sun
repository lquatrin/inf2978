Once upon a time in the dark ages,
where sunlight has faded,
all hope for glory and the living has vanished.
A dark legion came out of the north,
spreading evil on the earth.
Evil controlled life and the skie.
The sun formed black.
As a black hole of eternity.
All the living turned into ghouls.
Cannibalisticly possed .
Rexus Lucifer Infernus.
The Black Sun, rised at an age of doom.
The Black Sun, here for those who are evil.
The Black Sun, kill and free you're soul.
Obsessed, possesd by that mirroring atracting dark whole of doom
Under the black sun we fight and die.
