Trapped in a nightmare
lost and hellbound
Two leaders are at command
the pressure of countdown
Tendency toward the threat
survival a main reason
A live in piece is what they ask
still aliies are in treason
The eagle flies
The red replies
An evil game
Proved insane
No need to play
they'll find a way
The hopes are high
To live or die
The only safe place
Deep in space a foolish race
battleships that fly
The people that pay the toll
explosions in the sky
asking why the children die
no one to blame proved insane
no need to play they'll find a way
a searching race for the only safe place
The eagle flies
The red replies
An evil game
Proved insane
No need to play
they'll find a way
The hopes are high
To live or die
The only safe place
