Finding your fate
Aloudly you scream
In a world filled with pain and
Shattering dreams
Your back’s to the wall
With nowhere to go
This could be the day
Cuz your time’s running low
They poison your mind,
Darken your life
Fear’s closing in
Stabbing down like a knife
Turning away from this warped
Midless game
Don’t hesitate when they call out your name
Cuz then you will see
How life isn’t free
It’s death on the run
The war has begun
You’re marked on the streets
You’re a bloodchild on his feet
Game of death is reaching for your pit
Run for your life its victory or defeat
Lurking in the shadows
You’re safe for a while
The odds have been raised,
And aces are wild
Your body trembles
How much can you take
The hunter is at hand
And he’s ready to take
Your neck stiffens now
You know you’ve been found
Sirens slash through your veins
In this horror filled lane
Your life theu will drain
Cuz it’s death by torture and pain
