Oh feel the despair
The hopeless prepare
To mock and deface
The whole Human Race
The Last generation
It’s the end of the nations
It’s coming true
All around you
Don’t hold your breath
And wait for death
Tomorrow might not come
Standing here, it’s
time to fear
There’s no where to run
The living and the dead
Don’t walk in the night
Put up a fight
Time will tell
Life’s like hell
The Last generation
It’s the end of the nations
It’s coming true
All around you
Don’t hold your breath
And wait for death
Tomorrow might not come
Standing here, it’s
time to fear
There’s no where to run
The living and the dead
(Lead)
Oh darkness awaits
The curtain will fall
Changing the pace
On the whole Human Race
(Repeat chorus)
The living and the dead
