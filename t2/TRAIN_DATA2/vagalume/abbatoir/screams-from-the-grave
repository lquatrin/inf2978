They come in the night
And they’re searching for prey
The look in their eyes will burn you away
Piercin’ the wastelands they sweep
Thru the plains
Cutting the darkness just like a blade
Nothing can stop them
They’re headed your way
Driven by vengeance and swinging in chains
The grinding of metal, The clashing of steel
Bloodchilling screams, Streak thru the fields
Screams from the grave
Screams from the grave
The sound of an icepick tearing the flesh
Hearing the cries emerge from the depths
Casually butchered at modern cost
Innocent beings turn to the lost
Nothing can stop them
They’re headed your way
Driven by vengeance and swinging the chains
The grinding of metal, The clashing of steel
Bloodchilling screams, Streak thru the fields
(Lead)
Approaching the headstones lining the graves
The remains were buried and given their names
The horror still haunts me
When I’m in the dark
Watching the figures of yesterday’s mark
Nothing can stop them
They’re headed your way
Driven by vengeance and swinging the chains
The grinding of metal, The clashing of steel
Bloodchilling screams, Streak thru the fields
Screams from the grave
Screams from the grave
Screams from the grave
Screams from the grave
