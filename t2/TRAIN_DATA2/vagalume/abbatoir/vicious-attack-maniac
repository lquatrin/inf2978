He walks in the streets
He talks in your sleep
He stares in your eyes
He laughs as you cry
Silence is his way
Slicing thru the day
A blinding flash of light
Watch him kill on sight
Hiding in the shadows
The angers burning bright
A twelve inch metal blade
It’s time to taste the pain
Chorus:
Maniac…On Your Track
Maniac…The Looser’s Back
He’s walking in the streets
He’s talking in your sleep
He’s staring in your eyes
He’s laughing as you cry
Off the beaten track
There’s no turning back
A homicidal man
Roaming thru the land
A savage on the prowl
It’s all happening now
Putting people to rest
His never ending quest
Chorus:
Maniac…On Your Track
Maniac…The Looser’s Back
Maniac…On Your Track
Maniac…The Looser’s Back
Cutting them all down
Salvations’ underground
A mercenary’s will
Using speed and skill
Eating human flesh
Dressed in steel mesh
Society’s the blame
Now he’s gone insane…
