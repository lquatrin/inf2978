Apocalypse in ten weeks
Astronomical secrets
Elect the saints
We won't neglect
Man began to multiply
Daughters born to them
For the chosen to select
Sworn and bound by mutual exsecration
The remainder all of them
Engaging the women one by one
Teaching sorcery, enchantment to the sun
Bring on the damned
A wrath will fall on earth
Burning the land
A moral to their song
Bring on the damned
Their words will be condemned
Burning the land
Will they live to see the end
Teaching men the power of steel
Blasphemy increased corruption their will
Hand and foot their ruler is bound
Cast into the darkness, he's going down
Chorus
Bring on the damned
A wrath will fall on earth
Burning the land
A moral to their song
Bring on the damned
Their words will be condemned
Burning the land
Will they live to see the end
