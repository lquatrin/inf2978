*Timbaland*
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East coast (feel me)
West Coast (feel me) (repeat x 4)
Boy, I've been watchin you
like the hawk in the sky that flies
and you are my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin heads
I know that one of these days (days)
We gon hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell you but
Chorus:
If I, If I let you know you can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go,  is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody?
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone sleeps (sleeps sleeps)
I'll be waitin there with my trench, my lugzs, my hat,
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
(don't speak, you know that will be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trustin you with my heart,
my soul I probably shouldn't let ya but
Chorus:
If I If I let this go
you can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
I hope your responsible
Boy gotta watch my back
cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-good
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
*Timbaland*
Baby girl
I'm the man from the big Va
won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking-shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Make the playa haters believe
Don't cha know (what) gotta tell somebody
*Aaliyah*
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
Chorus:
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking about nobody
Are you responsible

Cause I'm not just anybody

Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
Chorus:
You can't tell nobody

I hope your responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
