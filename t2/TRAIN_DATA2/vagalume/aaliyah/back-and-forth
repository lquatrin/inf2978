Let me see you go back
(Oooh is the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth
(repeat 4x)
Verse 1:
It's Friday and I'm ready to swing, (hey)
Pick up my girls and hit the party scene
Tonight, oh oh oh it's alright
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
Cause you know it's alright

So Mr.Dj keep the music groovin (keep on groovin)
Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin)
Let me see you, let me see you go...

Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Verse 2:
Now's the time for you to make your move,
To the dancefloor (Woah)
So throw your hands in the air (Yeah)
And wave 'em round like you just don't care (Why?)
Ooh it's the L-I-Y-A-H, rippin' up the stage
I got jazz personality, G. mentality, beats for soul train

So Mr.Dj keep the music groovin

Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin)
Let me see you, let me see you go...

Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
