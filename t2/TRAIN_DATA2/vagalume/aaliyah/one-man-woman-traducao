Playa: I got a car a J-O-B
I'm an independent man God is blessing me
A lot of girls that i can call
9 times out of 10 i don't call them at all
The fun and games are overdue
I miss having someone to answer to
I got a house i got a key
There's one more thing that i really need
chorus: I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause i'll be your man plus your friend (Well here i am)
I need a one man woman
And you need a one lady man (I understand)
Girl you don't have to find another
Cause we can be lovers and friends (Well here i am)
Aaliyah: I saw you out with all the guys
I love the way you look with those big brown eyes yeah
And if it were up to me
We'd both run away and start a family
And on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm giving you 11 boy you're worth that much
only you can rescue me
I will provide anything you need
chorus: repeat 4 times
bridge; Haven't i proved to you
I think i'm ready for you
Baby don't fight my love
Baby invite my love
Haven't i proved to you
I think i'm ready for you
Baby don't fight my love
Baby invite my love
chorus; repeat until song ends
