Gave you chances
On top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted
My reality is all your exshalities
'Cause insanity
Why you askin me?
Took my kindness
For a sign of weakness
My own blindness
'Cause my sadness
No longer am a slave
Over your madness
I am glad it's finally over
Chorus:
Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name
See your qualities are
Less than pleasing
I got more than
One reason for leaving
It's time to close shop
Open new chapters
See new beginnings is
What I'm after
Get your skeletons up
Out my closet
Don't make me lose it
I just might lose it
Who do you think
You are now?
(Yeah)
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
(Can't believe)
Who do you think
You are now?
(Yeah, yeah)
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
(Oh yeah babe)
Who do you think
You are now?
(Who do you think you are?)
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is
Forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya till you've left
'Cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that
I'm here all by myself
Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)
Who do you think
You are now?
I can't believe you've
Got the nerve boy
(Yeah, yeah)
Repeat chorus
Yeah, yeah
You've got the nerve boy
Yeah, yeah
You've got the nerve boy
(Fades)
