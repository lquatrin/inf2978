Hey...
Yeah, hey... yeah...
Oh, ho
You wanna handcuff me?
But yo, I don't know what to tell ya 
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy?
Boy, I don't know what to tell ya 
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna wall around me?
I swear, I don't know what to tell ya 
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key?
But no, I don't know what to tell ya 
(Don't know what to tell ya)
Incarcerations what I'm facing 
When I'm with you
You're watching my every move
Try'n to pick up on some clues
We play twenty questions 
Every time I walk in or out the door
What are you bothered for?
(What are you bothered for?)
Getting crunk before you're sure
It's gonna take T-R-U-S-T
To keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take (it's gonna take)
T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E crackin'
Stressin' and second guessin'
Me time and time again
We go from lovers back to friends
Gotta put this to an end
Hey, yeah..
(Hook)
You wanna handcuff me?
No, I don't know what to tell ya
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my intimacy?
Boy, I don't know what ta tell ya
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You wanna wall around me?
I swear I don't know what to tell ya
(Don't know what to tell ya)
You want my lock and my key?
But no I don't know what to tell ya
(Don't know what to tell ya)
No justifications for your actions
Should'a been somewhere relaxin'
Don't compare me to your last one
I can't help that she was a fast one
A sassy one
I'm a classy one
I can keep 'em from gettin at me, huh
Seems like that should make you happy, huh?
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E crackin
I can't deny or lie
I tried to put up with you
These insecurities everyday
Pushin' my love away, hey
(Hook 2x)
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E
It's gonna take (its' gonna take)
Take T-R-U-S-T to keep our L-O-V-E crackin'
