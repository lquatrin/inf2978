yo turn my music up....
up some more...
up some more....
up a little bit more....
mama always told me to be careful who i love,
and daddy always told me make sure he's right.
i always had my eyes on this one paticular guy
i was to shy so i decided to write
(chorus) i'm sending him a 4 page letter
and i enclosed it with a kiss,
and when i write them, he better get it on time
(repeat)
people always say-ing that i play myself for you
they say that you don't even notice me  (me x6)
baby when i get the nerve to come to you
promise me that you won't dis me
(chorus)
(bridge)
i'm writing you a love letter tonight
you better keep watch cause the mailman's coming
(ohhh yes he is....ohhhiii)
i'm writing you a love letter tonight (tonight)
better keep watch cause the mailman's coming
(ohhhiiii)
(chrous x2)
ohhhhh get it on time....
