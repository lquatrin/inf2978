Hey there, get nasty boy
It's been a minute
And I could say my life has changed
Since you came
This is your strongest trick
You worked a miracle
While they say I'm sprung, I say
Baby you love me
They say you a baller
I hear you're just a player
And all my friends tell me
I should have never dated
But I'm in love with you
And I'ma have to tell em
Quit hatin on him, don't be jealous
I'm into you boy, I can be
Your world, your world
Boy this don't mean that I gotta be
Your girl, your girl
Had had to tell my friends, my girls, …my girls
Hey, first I seen you in a beamer
And then I saw the lexus
I knew by the benzes, with the 20 inch rims on em
And a lot of ex girlfriends
I bet they still call
Well I can't say I blame em
Cause you have somethin
They say you a baller
I hear you're just a player
And all my friends tell me
I should have never dated
But I'm in love with you
And I'ma have to tell em
Quit hatin on him, don't be jealous
Your world, your world
I'm into you boy, I can be
Your world, your world
Boy this don't mean that I gotta be
Your girl, your girl
Had had to tell my friends, my girls, …my girls
Your world, your world
I'm into you boy, I can be
Your world, your world
Boy this don't mean that I gotta be
Your girl, your girl
Had had to tell my friends, my girls, …my girls
They say you a baller
I hear you're just a player
And all my friends tell me
I should have never dated
But I'm in love with you
And I'ma have to tell em
Quit hatin on him, don't be jealous
