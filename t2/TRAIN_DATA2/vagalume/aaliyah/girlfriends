Met a nigga in this chat room in yahoo
said meet him at the saloon at high noon
at the corner of a market in June
with the option of coping a room
now I’m already knowing that
he's tryin to persuade me
generously
tryin to penetrate me
wanna run and stop me
wanted me to ride him
how dare he try to put a price on me
it is I the great one
and that’s an understatement
had to stay to steps ahead of him
give a hell
about the ice or the rose or the rims
or the house at the lake with the Benz
i'm as priceless as priceless gems
I’ma fight for the right for the fends.
just for the sake of these niggaz like him
::Aaliyah::
I pulled up to the bar
in my halter top
and i'm lookin hot
we hit the spot
so many eyes on me
Yau-sha-meen
did you see
what I just seen
in them jeans
said he caught my eye
took a double take
lets double date
pick a place
go ballin and outta control
Drive him home
use my phone
call Tyrone
and tell em
Chorus
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya'll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do?
Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya'll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do?
Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you never start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
::Yaushameen::
We can double date em
shake em
heartbreak em
I’ll say I’ma like em
and just
let em keep on kickin it
fake'n
for goodness sake'n
we goin'
never gonna catch no feelings
these dealing are awful phony
willing
to get something poppin
don't clock
when they'll be no panties droppin
huh
::Aaliyah::
I'm a big old flirt
In a mini skirt
Hey muscle shirt
Getcha feelings hurt
Don't get to cozy wit me
Privacy
We don't need
We'll be just conversating
On a scale of 10 he's a solid 5
Tryin to get some play
No not today
So sorry I got to go
Don't he know?
Head to toe
I ain't feel nothin but his clothes~
::Chorus::
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya'll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do?
Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
We talk like ya'll do
And the dirt that you do
What make you think we don't do?
Me and my girlfriends
We make creep calls too
And if you never start actin up
We got someone else to fall to
Me and my girlfriends
::Yaushameen::
what (x4)
We talk ya'll
We creep like ya'll
We ball like ya'll
Like this
We’re undeniable
We talk like you do
We ball just like you do
(no denying it)
We get numbers too
We creep just like you do
(an sure your proud of it?)
We pick out the studs???? ~not sure bout this part~
We creep just like guys
(you know he's hiding it)
We do just like you
We do like you do
