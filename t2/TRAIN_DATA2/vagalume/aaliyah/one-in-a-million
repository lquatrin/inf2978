Love ya babe love ya babe love ya babe
Love ya babe love ya babe love ya babe
Love ya babe love ya babe love ya babe
Love ya babe love ya babe love ya babe
Baby you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give it can't be replaced
See no one else loves me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
Wanna please you in any way I can
I wanna share my world don't you understand
(Chorus:)
Your love is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long
Your love is one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All day long
Turn me inside out
Make my heart speak
Need no one else you are all I need
Personality and everything you do
Makes me love everything 'bout you
Your smile, your style is so fly
I can't deny
I got a crush on you and that is true indeed
And I'm diggin you
You make me believe that
(Chorus)
I'll give you
Anything you want from me
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything your soul desires
I'll give you
Anything you want from me
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything
(Chorus)
(repeat 'til end)
