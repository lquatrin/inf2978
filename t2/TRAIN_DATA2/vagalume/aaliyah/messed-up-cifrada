VERSE 1:
You don't say, that I'm pretty
All the simple things, adding
Up to, big ones
And that is where you messed up
Movies, or flowers - hours, not knowing
Where you are or who you with
And baby that is where you messed up
CHORUS:
You keep on acting like 
I really need - what
I don't need - what
Better get your act together
Can't keep on holdin' on, waitin' for you
And baby, that is where you messed up
(repeat)
VERSE 2:
I don't need, your money
No dinners, I've got jewelery
Winner, to loser
And baby that is where you messed up
You're takin' me, for granted
Expect me to, stay right here
Wait on you, while you have your fun
And baby that is where you messed up
CHORUS
BRIDGE:
You're headin' straight for the gate
It's time to cut my dead weight, yeah you
(And baby that is where you messed up)
I heard it all a thousand times
Tried to play with my mind, yeah you
(And baby that is where you messed up)
She don't need you dog
That's where you went wrong
Uh-uh, I don't need you dog
See that is where you messed up
She don't need you dog
That's where you wenet wrong-wrong-wrong
She don't need you dog
And that is where you messed up
CHORUS
