I gave it all to you
With no questions asked
I wanted a future
Who cares about the past
That first arguement
you up and left
I seen a change in you words i won't accept
I thought i had lost you
When you twist back my arm
The man i thought i knew
Would do me no harm
And that ran through my mind, Over again
I promised myself you won't put your hands on me again
Never no more
I didn't sleep last night
I held my pillow tight
Now trust me when i say, you have been told
I'm telling you never to touch me no more
Never no more
I should've left you when you called me out my name
I stooped to your level replied you the same
Now here we are again you at my throat
Now i see the same old change that i did before
I'd walk away from you at the drop of a dime
Cause all of this treatment is way out of line
And that ran through my mind over and over again
I promised myself you wont put your hands on me again
Never no more
Never, you know i'd rather give you your space
Cause i just don't know what to or not to say
stay out your way or get in your face
i just know you better not touch me no again
Or I, i'd walk away that is one game i refuse to play
I didn't sleep that night
i held my pillow tight
now trust me when i say you have been told
i'm telling you never to touch me no more
Never no more
