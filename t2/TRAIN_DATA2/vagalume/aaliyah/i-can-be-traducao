Verse 1
Maybe I'm just wrong
For feeling the way I do
Thoughts indescent
Want to propose them to you
I know you have a girl
I don't want to tie
When you're free one night
Just make those hours mine
Chorus
I can be the other woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That'll be alright, alright, alright
Verse 2
Love just ain't my thing
But half of you might be
Enough for two or more
Don't hurry to me in need
Fine like expensive wine
Drunk off one glass of you
I think more might be too much
So weekends for me are cool
Chorus ('til end)
