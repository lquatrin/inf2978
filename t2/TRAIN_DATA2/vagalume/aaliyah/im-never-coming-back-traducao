Verse 1: I gave you all of my love, all to you
and you don't appriciate the things that i do (things that i do)
I gave you all of my time cause you blew my mind
I let you do me wrong cause your love had me so blind (i was blind)
Chourus: i once was young, but i'm all grown up
and i don't find love and i used to love you
you tried to play me and then pursuade me
i still remember the pain you gave me
i can't believe you i gotta leave you
i'm packing up and you can hit the road jack
you can take these things that you gave me
cause i'm never coming back
Verse 2: all i wanted was a little love
but you chose to hang out all night with the boys
so what are saying am i wasting time
trying to claim something that's not even mine (i was blind)
Chourus
Bridge: why'd you hurt me, why'd you hurt me
why you hurting me so bad
gave you my time, played with my mind
why you wanna make me sad
why'd you hurt me, why'd you hurt me
why you hurting me so bad
gave you my time, played with my mind
why you wanna make me sad
Chourus
