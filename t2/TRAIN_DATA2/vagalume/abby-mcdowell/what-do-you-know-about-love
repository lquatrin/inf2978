Shut up.
Don't talk to me.
I'm sick of hearing 'bout what supposed to be.
I'm tired of all the lies.
Don't want to fantasize.
Just shut up and go away.
You said you loved me.
That wasn't true.
I cried out all my tears now no more sad and blue.
I'm standing on my firm ground.
Don't want you around here.
Just shut up and go away.
Falsehoods are not the games I play.
So why don't you just carry your ass away.
You said you loved me.
