Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our land.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our land and our trees,
The birds and the bees.
Come see for yourself.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our seas.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our seas and our fish.
They're being selfish.
Come see for yourself.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our sky.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our sky and our birds,
The breath of our words.
Come see for yourself.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our hope.
Come see for yourself.
See what they've done to our hopes and our schemes,
And all of our dreams.
Come see for yourself,
And then decide.
