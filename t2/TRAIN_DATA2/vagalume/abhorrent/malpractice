Believed that your power was forever
Dont leaving rock upon rock
Demolishing em all like a big tornado
Ignoring tears and pain
Destroyed dreams and distorted the truth
Provoking bitterness and contradictions
But today no more exist your brightness
Just the weight of your ashes
What did you think?
What did you want more?
Liar!!!!
Damned!!!!
Bastard!!!!
Burn!!!!
Burn!!!!
And now the wind takes your ashes
