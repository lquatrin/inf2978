Save your breath brave warrior
Because your lady you'll never see
She's gone, all alone
She belongs to eternity
In the land of dreams she rests
With the angels around her
The body's lying here
While the soul is living there
You must leave now, there's nothing
that you can do
The sounds of war are calling you
Now she rests in peace, the peace
you never knew
For the blood on your lips ...
She waited day by day
For the loved one, so far
Echoes of the battle
Rumbling deep on the heart
And them, you just came back
But now it's too late
Heaven is her place
And lonely is your fate
Go back to your fight
Your home is not here
But remember, brave warrior
Your time is always near...
