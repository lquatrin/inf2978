Dark
The darkest night, embrace your soul with rage
Hate
More pure than faith, drag you and swallow you whole
Like a spawn from hell
Back from prison cell
Evil points at you (Evil)
Another chance for regret
Black
Surround your eyes, blind the sins, the hatred
Pain
You feel inside, has bring you back to life
