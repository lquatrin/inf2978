When I try to remember the beginning
The whole thing comes like a dream
That don't bring me laughs
And something might be reality
The nothing, the empty
Without light
Without a way
I still have regards
From what I've been but, who am I?
Prisoner of one life that
I don't know the past
Due to scare of what I've been
Today I hide myself in darkness
Catching the few that rest
Waiting for the end of the line
When I'll find what I think it's real
To quench my thirsty for the truth
Finishing my sufferings and fears
Ahead of me like a thick haze
When I try to remember the beginning
The whole thing comes like a dream
That don't bring me laughs
And something might be reality
