During his whole life, he didn't produce
And tried to tread and smash
the other ones
The time for regret has gone
As the life that was given to him
Only shadows you can see
And from them, voices accuse you
There'll be no chance for regret
During his whole life, he didn't
trust in nobody
As suicidal your surrender
yourself to the vice
And today you're the prisoner
of your own construction
Now look and enjoy your own destruction
Destruction of man that was brave
In fact, destruction of a slave
Running out from his mistake
Cause despair will be his destiny
with those who did the same mistake
There will be no time
