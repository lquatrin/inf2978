Spreading all
Hands on all
Your guns, your uniform
You act, omnipotent
Reckless fault
Fuck you & you all
You pass your stress
Your fears into me
But Will
Will rise
Anger & Hate
So mine
Blood will never lie
Close my eyes
Tell me lies
Your fucking life of misery
What none pretend you try to be
Feel your wrath
No pride left
You wake, no time
No shit, no life
Who made you GOD
Not that badge, not that uniform
No shit, nothing
