Face
The shelter, (the) pit you lie
Mind
The eye, to learn
Break
The walls (that) keep you dumb
Mine
Only my low life
Scream For your soul
Lie Burn and sold
Fear Your choking life
Pain you visualize
You got to strain
You have to strain me
You need to strain yourself
You have to strain me
Dead
Mankind all dead inside
Mind
The eye, to learn
Break
The rules (that) keep me in
Mine
Only my dead life
