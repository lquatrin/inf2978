May I go?
Where at one step to the real life
the wind lets me know
If my soul
Dreads what my body has dreaded so
I wanna know how far to go
What they call the end
If it's only a bad dream,
the darkness, a scream
Or a cruel fate that passes as my friend
May I go?
Where at one step to the real life
The seeds grow in the snow then I'll show
That this slippery step is really below
I wanna see by where I'm free
By where will be my last breath
If this is really for me, the end's key
To be at one step to the real life
Is to be at one step to death
