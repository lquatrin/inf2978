Built by him, fear the anger of his insanity
Hearse one more undertake him take him to the core
No one to stop, no one to dare, he rules this place with a clenches hand
No way to fight, it's never too late
Concel the panic and join...
The family
Keep you haunted, lost and lonely
Watching all the way, he'll be your eyes Seeking, within
Praising hell, loathing myself for the innocence
Plead no more, something he'll ignore
A devil in human shapes, his misery's one to shame, spinning reality
Sinking in words profane, his wishes will be yours
Concel the agony and join...
