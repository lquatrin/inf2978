At the edge of infinity
Crimson drops leave my hands
In this dark chamber
My journey begins
The gates
To the spirit world
It's secrets now open wide
My life slips away
I flew over dark landscapes
A palace of fog
The gathering of immortals
On the seventh day
In the nether realm
Cold moonlight
Translucent spirits
Whisper my name
Infernal power
A place of black blasphemy
It's infinite wisdom
The key
Absorbed in shadows
Lifeless in the spirit realm
A depressive vision of pure black
The gathering of immortals
In the nether realm
Cold moonlight
Translucent spirits
Whisper my name
Majestic and ancient
Forever night
The gathering of immortals...
