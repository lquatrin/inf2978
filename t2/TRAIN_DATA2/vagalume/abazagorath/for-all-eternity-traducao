On a depressive winter night
I wander through
This majestic pagan forest
Memories of ancient times
Fly into my mind
A dark grey spirit
Composed of moonlight shadows
Guides me towards
The forest's blackest depths
Whispers in the night sky
It's melancholy enters my soul
Touching the silent creature
So ancient and cold
In blackness unveiled
I come upon the gate
I feel my mortality slip away
It's cold blue light I cannot resist
It's spirits carrying me away
Into the gate
Transcending all life
To a world beyond
Into the deepest dark
Finally at his side
At the edge of eternity
Whispers in the night sky
It's melancholy enters my soul
Touching the silent creature
So ancient and cold
