I am the mask
I am the will of those that were
When time was not
I am the voice of those most ancient
Cloaked with chaos
Hiding amidst the stars
Priest of the ether
Dweller in the air
That hath many faces
That none shall recall
In the dreams of men
They know my whispers
Yet no man can know
My ever shifting forms
Hear the crawling chaos
That calls beyond the stars
The waves freeze before me
The gods dread my call
Wherever my footsteps turn
Surely men must die
Mightiest of messengers
Haunter of the dark
Stalker of the stars
The faceless god
Your cities will shatter
Your temples will fall
The sunken kingdoms
Will rise from the sea
I will set the stars
That open the portals
From the cosmic gulfs
My lieges shall return...
