The breath beneath an obscene gaze, Emerged in a tempest, intense and violent. From the foulest gouge of oppression. Stormed a burning unclean air
Ominous black shadows, Overtake the fortress, Consume in the ground dead, The whores of devotion
Lay impregnated with my sins, Burning in the cunts of christ. Beneath the moon and evil sign, A sun obscured in their blood
Like a thick velvet robe, stifling, Enveloped in its embrace. Standing to spit upon the cross of god, Smothering the embers of deceit
I am the fallen angel
The murderous winds of desire and hate, Rising from the seas of our soul, Like the black fog that clings to the mountains. Rising from below
Hung an old oak. Say nay to those whose stiffened limbs, Sway on elongated necks, yet they may look towards you
Those priests that hang like leaves on dead limbs, Against the blackened skies of my mind
