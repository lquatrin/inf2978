Thee I invoke serpent of the deep
Thee I invoke Leviathan
Horned serpent of the deep
Thee I invoke doomed serpent of the deep
Satan!!!
Open the gate that I may enter
Lucifer!
Spirit of the deep,
Watcher of the gate
Remember, in the name of our father, Enki
Before the flight,
Lord and master of magicians
Open the gate that I may enter
Open, else I attack the gate
Open, I say else I break down this vase
Open, else I attack the walls
Open, else I use all my force
Open the gate, else I cause the dead to rise
And devour the living
Open the gate, else I give the dead power over the living
Open the gate, else I make the dead to out number the living
Satan!
Spirit of the deep
Watcher of the gate
Open, may the dead rise and smell the incense
