We rule the night
Our hearts are strong
For a thousand years
We lay in wait
Ancient magick
Propelled against the strength of time
From darkened places mysterious
Opened gates release swirling unearthly mist
Our might has returned
Over nightrealms we flew
Channeling our power ad hate
From Darkness We Rise
To conquer the dying faith
Ancient steel!
Ancient steel!
Demons roar apocalypse
Triumph in fire
The dead have joined our side
Bathed in the gleam of ten million shields
Storming war on the steps of heaven
Bathed in the spray of angel's blood
We swear the ancient oath of black
By the wrath of damnations
We are crowned - with fists to the sky
Now and forever
A crumbling earth
Cradling the dying men of god
Impaled on the spiked tridents of Hell
Steel blasphemers descending
Our race has gathered in victory
On the bloodied battlefields
Megiddo, our strength
The ashes of tetragrammaton
Fade in flames
Faith dies... so mote it be!
