Bled dry are the waters of Jordan
Crumbled now golgitha
Ransacked are the ancient Citys TURNED TO RUBLE
The oasis of Jesus now destroyed
Through the eyes of Azazel i watch there end
One by one the churches crumble
Holy civilization destroyed
Nothing now but worthless smoldering bricks
(chorus)
Tearing down the framework of idiocrisy
Iconoclasts Of the ancient ways strike
Sign of the horns in the distance
The feeble threefold spirits overthrown!
Let the blood of the shepherd overflow the rivers
Let the head of the god of man roll
Set ablaze on his meaningless cross
Cthulhu Awaiting in the mist for its holy sacrifice
"Shub Niggurath show thy young to the world
For its time to Thou Now Show Thy Power"
(chorus)
Tearing down the framework of idiocrisy
Iconoclasts Of the ancient ways strike
Sign of the horns in the distance
The feeble threefold spirits overthrown!
