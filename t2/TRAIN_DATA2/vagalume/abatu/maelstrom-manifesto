Right now
I feel it surge
The hatred that renders me pure
Restoring The disdain
Once lost but now come forth!
For i see
Great visions
Of cataclysm
For i see
Great catastrophes
In my favor, in my name
Sacrifices to me
For i am the new god
the true creator
great masses for me
The new lord
messiah of reality
Trampled now
Are the ways of christ
Broken down his weak sign
The cross
such a feeble throne
It doth burn in its own hell
Jesus and his flock
Sheered, skinned, and bleed
Bleed of ignorance
Bleed of life!
Sacrifices to me
For i am the new god
the true destroyer
great masses for me
The new lord
messiah of reality
(Solo)
My peers my subject
fade into the world, unknown
you walk among, the heretics
you walk among the strong
The weak the slave race
destined to follow our every command
I, fallen one, master of the great abyss
do call this a new dawn, and new beginning, the right millennium
