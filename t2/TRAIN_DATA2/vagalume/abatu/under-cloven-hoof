We smash the crumbling cross
burn the symbol of the zombie nations
show of might and force
hellfire burning within our veins
satans mark left on our souls
we are the just ones!
we who are not prisoners of the mind
bend to no false words of a desperate god
we are the alien elite
putting the flames to their holy lies
we stand in the flames of enlightenment
our morning star burns their darkned lies!
(pre chorus)
rising from flames
infinite will
spread black wings
destroy your lord!
(chrous)
CAST FROM TYRANY
DESTROYER OF YOUR GOD OF HYPOCRISY
WE STAND IN THE FACE OF GOD
JESUS UNDER CLOVEN HOOF!
FALLEN TO ENLIGHTENMENT
REBEL AGAINST YOUR DECEPTION
WE SPIT IN THE FACE OF YOUR GOD
JESUS UNDER CLOVEN HOOF!
we are monoliths of carnage
ontop of the bodys of the pious
we are abominations
we are curses
manifested into flesh and blood
standing tall in blasphemy
we are machines of annihilation
blasting out blood and bones of judeo-islamic christian fools
spawns of the absu are we!
tremeble in fear in face of the one you hate
fear the cloven one, satan the true god of the earth or die
(pre chorus)
the arena shouts for christian blood
we will give them holy genocide
(chrous)
CAST FROM TYRANY
DESTROYER OF YOUR GOD OF HYPOCRISY
WE STAND IN THE FACE OF GOD
FALLEN TO ENLIGHTENMENT
REBEL AGAINST YOUR DECEPTION
WE SPIT IN THE FACE OF YOUR GOD
JESUS UNDER CLOVEN HOOF!
