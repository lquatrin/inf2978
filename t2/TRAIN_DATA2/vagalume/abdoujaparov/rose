Rose, Rose, I'm crying again
Rose, Rose, I'm crying again
In your heart there was always room for love
In your heart there was always room for love
I'm crying again
I'm crying again
In your heart there was always room for love
In your heart there was always room for love
When I said it didn't touch me I was lieing I guess
Ijust couldn't believe it was you in there
When they laid you to rest
Rose, Rose, I'm crying again
Rose, Rose, I'm crying again
In your heart there was always room for love
In your heart there was always room for love
