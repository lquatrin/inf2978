We were in bed, about 1am 
I was asleep, but not for long 
Darlin' thats gunfire, thats murder 
Turn out the lights love 
But darlin' thats MURDER 
Its no-one we know 
Lets just keep out of it 
A friendly cop came to our door 
Ask for our names, and did we hear the shots 
We told him our story, he wasn't surprised 
he said he couldn't live in Brixton 
I asked him "Why not?" 
He said there's gunfire, thers murder 
Turn out the lights love 
But darlin' thats MURDER 
Its no-one we know 
Lets just keep out of it 
A know that you think that we're callous 
Well its not exactly a crime 
Crooks killing crooks at the end of our street 
It happens all the time
