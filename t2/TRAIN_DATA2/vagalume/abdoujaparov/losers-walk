There's a hole and it's dead 
In the middle of my head 
If I reach in a nd touch 
Will my fingers turn to dust 
Some days you live 
Some days you love 
Some days I forgive 
Some days its just tough 
Is that Losers Talk? 
I've got a Loser's Walk 
I'm not a catolic 
I'm not a Jew 
Without Religion what would we do? 
What on earth is this cloud 
Its really bringin me down 
Is it something inside? 
Something I've denied 
Some days I live 
Some days I love 
Some days you forgive 
Some days it's just tough 
Is that Losers's talk? 
I've got a loser's walk 
I'm not Church of England 
I've no God or guru 
Without a jumbo jet, what will I do? 
There's a hole in my soul 
And it grows and it grows 
Till it swallows me and then it grows and grows again 
It swallows up the town 
Then it swallows up the sun 
It's a hungrly little hole 
It's a hungry bastard hole 
Sometimes it loves 
Sometimes it loves 
Sometimes it forgives 
Sometimes I give up 
If that's loser's talk 
I've got a loser's walk 
I'm not strict or orthodox 
I'm no sect voodooo 
Without an afterlife, what will I do?
