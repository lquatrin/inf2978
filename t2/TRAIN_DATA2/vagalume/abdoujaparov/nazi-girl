Why did she become a Nazi? 
She was a sweet and regular lefty 
She was my lover like no other 
I saw her downtown at a fascist demonstration 
She was with a few lads 
Romper Stomper I don't know how I could stop her 
She was wearnig a shirt with a red swastika 
Had a black armband and a hitler picture 
I don't know what she had against foreign faces 
Her own parents came from different races 
I saw her downtown at a fascist demonstration 
She was with a few lads 
Romper Stomper I don't know how I could stop her 
She was wearnig a shirt with a red swastika 
Had a black armband and a hitler picture 
I don't know what she had against foreign faces 
Her own parents came from different races 
I'd take a chance 
If I had just one answer 
I would take a chance 
If I had just one answer 
I'd take one more chance on my little baby 
If she'd remove her black bandana well now, maybe, maybe. 
Now she's looking for a different kind of street Cred 
She's got a number one skinhead 
I thought I gave her some satisfcation 
Then she joined National action
