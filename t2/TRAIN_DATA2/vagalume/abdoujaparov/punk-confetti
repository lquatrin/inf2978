Julie took a plate of cold spaghetti 
And threw it over John like punk confetti 
She didn't like the way he smiled and kissed 
She didn't like the way he smelt of piss 
It was the wedding of the grim 
How could she hitch her life to him? 
She took a cable car to rome 
The seven seas of home 
Then she met a lovely bloke 
Fed her on caviar and dope 
All he anted was a grope 
Bought her a car and they eloped 
Like punk confetti 
Julie had a fight with John Paul Getty 
Tore his shirt to shreds like punk confetti 
She didn't like the way he was so rich 
She threw it all away the stupid bitch 
It was the wedding of the grim 
How could she hitch her life to him? 
She took a cable car to roma 
The seven seas of home 
Then she met a lovely bloke 
Fed her on caviar and hope 
All he anted was a grope 
Bought her a car and they eloped 
Like punk confetti 
Julie took a plate of cold spaghetti 
And threw it over John like punk confetti 
She didn't like the way he smiled and kissed 
She didn't like the way he smelt of piss 
It was the wedding of the grim 
How could she hitch her life to him? 
She took a cable car to roma 
The seven seas of home 
Then she met a lovely bloke 
Fed her on caviar and soap 
All he anted was a grope 
Bought her a car and they eloped 
Like punk confetti 
Didn't have a hope 
It was a joke 
Like punk confetti
