I like my bourbon, buy me a beer
I love a drink like a cow loves a steer
Mix me martinis, gin would be nice
No faggy olives, no fuckin' ice
Drank up my money, pissed out my dough
Can't buy no bottle, no liquor store
Hey bartender, don't laugh at me
Screw you I got mine
White moonshine whiskey maker
Back bubbelin' in the woods
Jelly jar of poison, makes me feel real good
White moonshine whiskey maker
I'm makin' my witches brew
Just a drop of white lightnin'
Guaranteed to cure the blues
Hey johnny walker, walkin' too fast
Too damn expensive, go kiss my ass
Hey jack and jimmie and turkey too
Got to be rich to go drinkin' with you
Good rot-gut whiskey, grain alcohol
Couple of drinks and you'll bounce off the wall
Cat urination, parfait d'amour
Screw you I got mine
Fire!
Boom!
