It was in Stockholm town, I was feelin' fine
I had some JD before I left home
Took a cab to the place, I was flyin' in space
I was a king upon my throne
Headin' for The Zoo and we were you-know-who
Everyone was there in the crowd
Treat, Trash, Heavy Load and 220 Volts
Those who usually play so loud, allright
These are
The Rockin' Times, the rollin' days
We're Rock'n'Roll insane
The Rockin' Times, the rollin' days
We're rockin' to the grave
Joey Tempest took some singing lessons
and tried to make it big in the west
Well take my advice, take a helpin' hand
from the one that you know is the best
Martina and the girls in Aphrodite supplied all the satisfaction
Kee Marcello, the master of the guitar had some beers with his Easy Action
