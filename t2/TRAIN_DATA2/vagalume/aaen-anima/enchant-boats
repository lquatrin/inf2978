The weight of decision
The weight of pain
The weight of feelings
The weight of grave
Slave of the ocean of his regret
Slave of his rain..
It´s very hard to
Float on two ships
My enchant spirit
My bloody lips
When the boats of decision
Become to recede
Away from them
From place where (they) meet
 
I have to embark 
Only on one
Decide between two ships
Or to get growned
Sigh!!!!!
 
You will reproach your fault
On first or second boat
 
You will feel the weight of decision
On every boat
  
You will feel the tear that did not fall down
 
Endless amount
Of wounding boats
In time of human
Million thoughts
I¨m walking in my thoughts
I´m walking in tunnels
But every decision is 
Mine
