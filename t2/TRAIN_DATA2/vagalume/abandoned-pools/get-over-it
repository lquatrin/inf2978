Take me
Throw me in the street
Break me
Never let me be
You'll go on
I'll go on
Bitter as can be
Soon you'll see
You'll be sorry
Cruel thing
Stop this happening
Mean trick
Made me wanna quit
You'll go on
I'll go on
Bitter as can be
Soon you'll see
You'll be sorry
You broke everything
Still do to the stain
