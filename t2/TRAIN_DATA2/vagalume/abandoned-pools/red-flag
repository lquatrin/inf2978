We come confluxed 
Don't know how we are
I only hope you're getting what you're after
We can't sing out just like a dove
I'm crazy 
Overweight and for the year after
Stay back, stay back
I'm dangerous
As if, as if
You'd face me
You made the rope that you're hanging from
And the golden age of fear
Red Flag
And I'm coming for you
Red Flag
And I'm taking you down
Red Flag
Come on out and find
For that, I will forgive you
How many lives are you going through
And it's sharp
What you're stuck in to
Give me, give me
I know things
You don't, you don't
You don't wanna hear
The kids are sick
Of the products they pick
In the golden age of fear
Red Flag
And I'm coming for you
Red Flag
And I'm taking you down
Red Flag
Come on out and find
For that, I will forgive you
One face, called attention
I'm on a mission
Listen, listen
I'm talking
You got, you got
You got your number called
You're casting out
Just like a dove
In the golden age of fear
Red Flag
And I'm coming for you
Red Flag
And I'm taking you down
Red Flag
Come on out and find
For that, I will forgive you
I will forgive you
I will forgive you
I will forgive you
