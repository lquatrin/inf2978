What can I say dear, after I say I’m sorry
What can I do to prove it to you I’m sorry
I didn’t mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn’t care I wouldn’t feel like I do
I was so wrong, but right or wrong I don’t blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I made you cry and I’m so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say I’m sorry
