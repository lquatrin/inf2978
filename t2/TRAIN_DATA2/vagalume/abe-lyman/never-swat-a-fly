Never swat a fly, he may love another fly
He may sit with her and sigh the way I do with you
Never harm a flea, he may have a favourite she
That he bounces on his knee the way I do with you
Never stop a moth when he is gliding through the air
He may have a date in someone's flannel underware
Ah ah be carefull
Never spray a nit with a great big can of blitz
He may think  some nit has it the way I do with you
