Just one more chance.
To prove it's you alone I care for,
Each night I say a little prayer for,
Just one more chance.
Just one more night
To taste the kisses thay enchant me,
I want no others, If you'd grant me,
Just one more chance.
I've learned the meaning of repentance;
Now you're the jury at my trial.
I know that I should serve my sentence;
Still I'm hoping all the while you'll give me
Just one more word.
I said that I was gladto start out;
But now I,m back to cry my heart out
For just one more chance.
