Good morning, good morning
We've danced the whole night through
Good morning, good morning, to you 
Good morning, good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning, good morning, to you 
refrain:
When the band began to play
the stars were shining bright
Now the milkman's on his way
it's too late to say goodnight 
So goodmorning, goodmorning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning, good morning, to you 
refrain 
So good morning,
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning, good morning, to you
it's too late to say goodnight
so say good morning
Good morning, good morning
