Two by two, they go marching through,
The sweethearts on parade
I can't help crying as they pass me by,
The sweethearts on parade
I'd love to join them but,
But they, they go by me,
Cause it takes more than one to join their, their army
How I pine just to fall in line
With the sweethearts on parade
