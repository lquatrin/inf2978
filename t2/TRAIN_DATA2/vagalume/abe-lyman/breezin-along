I'm just breezin' along with the breeze,
Trailin' the rails, roamin' the seas.
Like the birdies that sing in the trees,
Pleasin' to live, livin' to please.
The sky is the only roof I have over my head;
And when I'm weary, mother Nature makes my bed.
I'm just goin' along as I please,
Breezin' along with the breeze.
I have been a rover since I was a child,
No one to love or care for me.
Knocked around all over, kinda grew up wild --
My home's wherever I may be.
Ain't no someone yearnin', wonderin' where I be;
I'm gone, but no one's missin' me;
Ain't no light a-burnin' ev'ry night for me;
I'm like a bird that's flyin' free.
I'm just breezin' along with the breeze,
Trailin' the rails, roamin' the seas.
Like the birdies that sing in the trees,
Pleasin' to live, livin' to please.
The sky is the only roof I have over my head;
And when I'm weary, Mother Nature makes my bed.
I'm just goin' along as I please,
Breezin' along with the breeze.
