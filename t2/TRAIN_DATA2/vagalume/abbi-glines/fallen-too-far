When you first looked at me
I forgot to breathe
That moment marked my hardened heart
I vowed never to leave
And the touch of your skin
Healed something deep within
That left me wanting more of you
The less I got the more it grew
Oh I couldn't help from falling, falling for you
So I'm standing here, oh girl you know
After all that we've been through we couldn't let it go
And as long as I'm alive, in your eyes I'll stare
Holding you so close I'll solemnly swear
That I have fallen too far
That I have fallen too far, too far for you
For you
When I finally found you
I finally found me
That day I won't soon forget
The reason for it all
I'll give you a new name
Nothing in life will be the same
The story is now complete
Our life and love is all we need
'Cause I couldn't help from falling
Falling for you
So I'm standing here oh girl you know
After all we've been through we couldn't let it go
And as long as I'm alive, in your eyes I'll stare
Holding you so close I'll solemnly swear
That I have fallen too far, that I have fallen too far
Too far for you
My heart is beating
Begging for you
This night will be
A dream come true
So fall, fall, fall into my arms
So I'm standing here oh girl you know
After all that we've been through we couldn't let it go
That I have fallen too far
That I have fallen too far
That I have fallen too far
Too far for you, yeah
For you
