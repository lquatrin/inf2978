Daylight fades away as I watch you from a distance
Darkness claims the sky and I wish you could only know
We're supposed to be miles away
But something draws me closer
We're supposed to be far away
But gravity brings us closer
Closer than your skin
Rebellion deep within, you've taken over me
And I can't seem to swim to the top of myself
I'm under your control
Wondering how we got here
Wondering how we got here to the place we should go
Oh- oh- oh- oh, yeah
The place we should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Souls aren't meant for things like this
Our worlds were never meant to collide
You're better off leaving
While you have something to leave behind
We're supposed to be miles away
But something draws me closer
We're supposed to be far away
But gravity brings us closer
Closer than your skin, rebellion deep within
You've taken over me and I can't seem to swim
To the top of myself I'm under your control
Wondering how we got here
Wondering how we got here to the place
We should go. we're supposed to be
Miles away... but something draws me closer
