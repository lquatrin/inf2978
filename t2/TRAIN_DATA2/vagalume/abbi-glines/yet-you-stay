You weren't meant for the ice
you weren't made for the pain
The world that lives inside of me, brought only shame
You were meant for castles and living in the sun
The cold running through me
should have made you run
Yet you stay
Holding on to me, yet you stay
Reaching out a hand that I push away
Yet you stay
When I know it's not right for you
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
I can't feel the warmth
I need to feel the ice
I want to hold it all in
Till I can't feel the knife
So I push you away and
I scream out you name
And I know I can't need you yet
You give in anyway
Yet you stay
Holding on to me, yet you stay
Reaching out a hand that I push away
Yet you stay
When I know it's not right for you
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
I can't feel the warmth
I need to feel the ice
I want to hold it all in
Till I can't feel the knife
So I push you away
I scream out you name
And I know I can't need
You give in anyway
Yet you stay
Holding on to me
Yet you stay
Reaching out a hand that I push away
Yet you stay
When I know it's not right for you
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
Holding on me
Yet you stay
Reaching out a hand that I push away
Yet you stay
When I know it's not right for you
Yet you stay
Oh, the dark will alway be my cloak
And you are the threat to unveil my pain
So leave, leave and erase my memories
I need to face the life that's meant for me
Don't stay and ruin all my plans
You can't have my soul
I'm not a man
The empty vessel
I dwell in is not meant to feel the heat you bring
I push yoa away
Yea
I push you away
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
Yet you stay
