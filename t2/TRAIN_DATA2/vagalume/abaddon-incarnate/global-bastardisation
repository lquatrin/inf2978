Cradle newborn bastard in hands that seep in sin, 
On looking through a crystal screen, 
The bastardiser grins, 
Soiling what was once a subtle and pure race, 
I embed myself within her 
And leae without a trace 
Engulf your frail existence, 
Rob you of your worth, 
Feel contaminated at the hour 
Of the bastard’s birth, 
Screaming through a smoke screen 
Created by his breath, 
Experience the shock 
And the wrath of the bastard’s threat 
BASTARD 
Bastardiser, conceived in death, 
Bastardiser, fear my threat 
Bastardiser, conceived in death, 
Bastardiser, fear my threat. 
Population rises 
As the bastards commence my reign, 
Blood replace raindrops, extirpate and main, 
Their sky becomes his eyes, 
Feeding from his vigor, 
Each one aims their weapon 
But it’s him that pulls the trigger.
