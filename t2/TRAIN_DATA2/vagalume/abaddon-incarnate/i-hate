The blackness tearing at my guts
I've tried so hard to master - to tame myself
Untamed being no control or purpose yet
I need a Djinn to guide my rage...
He comes!!!
In my dreams I hear him, a dweller between the worlds
An ancient evil force unleashed by my desires
He is my master and so I am his
For me are as the same, born of the same shit
He and I are one, our desires must be sated
My lust for her flesh with his thirst for my soul
Her neck in my hands, I am given the strength to rape
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
He comes!!!
