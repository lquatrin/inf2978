“Incest makes feel at home”
She knew no difference
The fact that it remained
A “secret” left an imprint
Sobbing as she takes his pain
Heavy breathing
Mental relapse like before
Now she’s bleeding
Self Portrait, of Hatred
Churning hatred in her head
He’s still speaking
Light switch on, relieve the dark
Rarely sleeping
Remedy will never end
While its vivid
Child within is between lies
Wake up screaming
Self Portrait, of Hatred
Churning hatred in her head
He’s still speaking
Light switch on, relieve the dark
Never sleeping
Self Portrait, of Hatred
