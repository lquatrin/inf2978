Reborn for the thousandth time, 
To live and breathe along side slime, 
Introduce reality, 
I strive to reach my destiny. 
Dying again, vicious circle spins, 
Rotating forever and before long I’m dead again. 
Made to relive a horrid past, 
How long will the torment last? 
Voices say to break the chain 
It comforts me that I’m insane. 
Dying again, vicious circle spins, 
Rotating forever and before long I’m dead again 
Reason with myself, vague as thought it seems, 
Running in a nightmare, repent recurring dreams, 
Memories aren’t renewed, they just expand instead, 
Staring at the ceiling from my saturated bed. 
Dying again, vicious circle spins, 
Rotating forever and before long I’m dead again
