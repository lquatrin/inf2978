Dying wasn’t easy, they still won’t leave me be
Electric currents shake me, but now I’ve broken free
There is no darkened tunnel, it’s nothing like they say
I’ve had enough of living, I’ve finally had my way
Resent repulsion
Solitude forbidden
Dangling, choked, taste your throat, this time I will succeed
I feel this end is needed, though some would call it greed
Blood speckled runners twitching, this ends relentless pain
This welcomed, extreme measure is what might keep me sane
Eternal solitude forbidden
Resent repulsion
Solitude forbidden
