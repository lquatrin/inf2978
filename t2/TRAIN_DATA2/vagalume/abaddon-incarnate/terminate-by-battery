Embrace the wickedness, seek out my niche,
Carried on from decades of confused chaotic bliss
Belittle what you cannot be, I intend to hammer you,
Study what’s inside, slenderize its worth
Terminate by Battery
Terminate by battery, keep the filth at bay,
Inject them with a poisoned fist, parry and crush their outlook
Inside my tear of wisdom, ignorance stays alive,
Pinch and squeeze till death, rust becomes you viewpoint
Terminate by Battery
Suffocate on soaking cloth, that which wraps your being,
Proposition of denial, insular in how you think
Suffocate on soaking cloth, that which wraps your being,
Proposition of denial, insular in how you think
So wallow in your rust and filth, repress your sickened glance,
You will fade, I’ve seen it, buried by the truth
Terminate by Battery
