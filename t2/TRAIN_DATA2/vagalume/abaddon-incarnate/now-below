Don’t try, to cover up, 
Stepping back, now looks away, 
Remind, me who you are, 
Your existence, frail, I’ll mar. 
White eyes, are strained and wide, 
Look at me, expression changes, 
Cold sweat, your gut sinks slow, 
Pain release, you’re now below. 
Red, sore neck, discolored eyes, 
Nosebleed starts while screaming lies. 
Hollow sound from swelling head, 
Scarred for life, 
Long for a darkened place, 
Warned you, you’d lose your face.
