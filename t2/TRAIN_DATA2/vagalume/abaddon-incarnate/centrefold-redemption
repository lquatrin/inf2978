Pull out queen, with legs part, dethrone the whore, itâ€™s been too long, 
Obliteration of this icon, strangled with her bloodied thong. 
Centrefold redemption 
The center page is missing, pinned up with her fellow cunts, 
His beauties reek of fakeness a special girl he now hunts. 
Centrefold redemption 
Crying as he grips her throat, blood vessels swell and burst, 
To score with her should be an honour, but he must kill her first. 
Centrefold redemption
