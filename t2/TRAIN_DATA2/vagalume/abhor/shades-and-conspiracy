Shades And Conspiracy
I can't live anymore condemned by this light. The shades knock to my entrance. Soon these walls will be slaughtered, the rocks will roll to the ground and I will rise myself. The chains will be dyed of red, my wrists will get back life and no more chainsâ€¦ 
The toll plays 
the song of the rooster has come 
the walls have surrendered 
and the shadows have armed me 
That jail and that sentence 
what have you taught me 
sister loneliness? 
The mother night has embrace 
the son of the sentence 
now I can reopen the eyes 
and see my darkness again. 
Silvery light 
weak entertainer of pain 
I owed attend only 
I owed breathe only 
Useless your chains have been 
as infamous you have tried the superiority 
but only blood 
the blood of my liberation 
among friendly shades and conspiracy.
