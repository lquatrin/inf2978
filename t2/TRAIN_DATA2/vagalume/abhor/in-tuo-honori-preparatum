In Tuo Honori Preparatum
Satani, magnus et potens, exaudi preces meas et benedicas tuae fructum .
High is the name of Satan our Father, forever will be praised in the ages of the ages. To You, Horned Father, I offer my soul, for You, Horned King, I sacrifice my life. I rise the Black Sword for defeat the force of god, forever will be protected the Infernal Goat, symbol of wickedness.
Satani, magnus et onnipotens, benedicas hoc istud vasculum in Tuo honori preparatum, per omnia opera Tua.
The abyss will recome out, will be chaos and the Satanic Domination will rule. Hail to You King of Hell and Lord of Evil, I ask asylum in the migthy Legion. High is the name of Satan our Father, forever will be praised in the ages of the age.
