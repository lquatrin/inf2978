Wandering Stone
Megalitics Altars, 
surrounded by ancient forces. 
Rediscover your essence, 
magician master. 
I am the wanderer 
that explores your soul 
and I am the stone 
on the seabed. 
I feel the strength increase, 
in an universal explosion. 
The morality of the actual age 
has abandoned me. 
I am the wanderer that swims in your blood 
and I am the stone that has stoned 
thousand martyrs. 
I'm possessed by a primordial hunger. 
I follow the dogmas of an ancient will, 
help me Old Man. 
I am the wanderer 
that is lost in the void 
and I am the stone 
that will become avalanche. 
I am the wonder 
that enchants your mind, 
the fire that melt your ice, 
the water that purify you 
and the wind that makes you fly.
