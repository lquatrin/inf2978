Sawah, wei maashee feil beilaad, saway
Vagabond, and walking between countries, vagabond.
Weil khatwa beinee wei bein habibee barah
And the step between me and my bveloved is "big"
Meish war bei-led, wana feeh hareib
A long journey, and I'm wounded in it
Weil leil yei-arab, weil nahar rawah
And the night approaches and the day goes
Chorus:
Wein laakom habibee, saleimulee alei
And if you see my beloved, say "hello" to him
Tameinuneel asmaranee, amla eil el ghorba fee
Reassure me how is my brown-looking girl doing so far away
Sawah, wana maashee layalee
Vagabond, I'm walking nights (sleepwalking)
Saway, wall daree bhalee
Vagabond, not knowing what I'm doing
Saway meil for-a ya ghalee
Vagabond, and the separation o my dear
Sawah, eih elee garalee
Vagabond, what has happened to me
We-saneen we-sneen wana dayeb bsho' wei haneen
And years and years and I'm melting in loginess and tenderness
Ayiz a-araf bass taree-o meineen
I want to know just where is his road
Chorus
Ya eounee ah ha eounee
My eyes oh my eyes
Eih garalak fein inta wei bi meil eih
What has happened to you and what are you doing?
Ya znounee a ya znounee mat seibounee
My worries oh my worries, leave me alone
Meish naaeis ana hier aleil
I'm worried enough about him
Lala areif ar-taah wana la-yeih sawaah
Neither can I rest and I am lost like a vagabond
Chorus
Ya amar ya naseenee
Oh moon, who's forgetting me
Raseenee alee ghayeib
Take me to the absent one
Nawarlee wareenee seikeit el habayeib
Enlighten me, show me the road to the beloved
Waseitak weseiya ya shaheid alay
I've made you primise, you who witnessed
Teikeelu alei beiya
To tell him of my state
Weilee aseitoo blayaleija
And what I've suffered during my nights
