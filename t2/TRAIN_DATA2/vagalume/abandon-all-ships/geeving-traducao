let me explain cause it drives me insane
just to know you are there seems like you don't care another ending the same
fuck you and everyone and everything
cause we all know whose king
when i'm still standing in the ring. it's so hard to say
couldn't run away, it's those games you played
wish you would've stayed. its so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away
in a dream she came to me, she came to me
blinded by the light, light put up a fight, put up a fight i couldn't see, couldnt see
i never knew this was a war. lost count at you're a whore
karma's fair but instead i'd rather see you dead
it's so hard to say. couldn't run away
it's those games you played wish you would've stayed, its so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away
in a dream she came to me, she came to me, blinded by the light, light, put up a fight, put up a fight, i couldn't see, couldn't see
i would walk through fire just to be with you
there's nothing in the world that i wouldn't do
run away, in a dream she came to me, she came to me, blinded by the light, light, put up a fight, put up a fight, i couldn't see, couldn't see
we don't give a fuck we just came to party. we don't give a fuck, we we we just came, we just came, we just came to party, we we just came to party
i don't give a fuck i just came to party
wish you would have stayed. stay with me
