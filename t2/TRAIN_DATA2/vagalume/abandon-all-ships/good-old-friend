Good old friend
It's been too long
My broken heart you mend
How they were so wrong
Your bad reputation
Is nothing more than motivation
They think they know you but they don't know shit about it
They think I need you, but I use you, I don't need shit.
I'd rather walk with you in the darkness of the night,
Than walk alone with no one lit up by the light
I wanna feel you when theirs nothing left inside
Fuck whatever they say girl, this moment feels so right.
I'm not afraid of the comedown
I'm not afraid.
You can't buy love but bitch, you'll love this shit
I'm so high up, fuck you.
I'll never quit.
