Born and raised original
You're just Tv typical
You think I'm just a gimmick?
From east to west you pussies mimic
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know
Is this city, throw it up
Toronto
Blinding lights, where I go
I look down from the top and it's crowded
Below
Rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I'm not
Fuck yeah, I have an ego, but you would too
If you had what I got
But we embrace, all of this hate
Bitch you're 15 minutes late
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know
Is this city, throw it up
Toronto
Blinding lights, where I go
I look down from the top and it's crowded
Below
(A-Game)
They only see us when they look up
Its kinda lonely where we've been standing
But we got perfect view that's Hd, wait 7d, Canon
That's flashing lights in my past life
Pilot mode about to take flight
Paparazzi where we go, cool boyz you can blame it on my ego
She say I got her wetter then Nemo
I work for everything I need so
I need more, a bad bitch, brains with a 4. average
Backwoods with a little bit of cabbage
And you know we killing this shit
And you know we about to take over
I advise you Abandon All Ships
Blinding lights, where I go
I look down from the top and it's crowded
Below
If you don't like us, fuck you
Forever Loney Crew
Flc ain't running
Uo is rising
You're with us, or against us
Aas is coming
New York's running
La's running
Yeah, you should be fucking scared
Toronto's coming
