I fear the struggle
I fear the strife
A fear of death
A fear of life
I fear for you
You fear for me
I fear for what
Will come to be
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
I got a feeling
I'm just scared
I'll start believing
When I see you there
Life's a portion
When you die its done
Pretend your something
Not fooling anyone.
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
