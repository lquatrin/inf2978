You paid attention
Was it time well spent?
Lies in the past, got dragged by the current
How can you basis what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august
Mist fills my lungs
Save me while I'm still young
Were lost in the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
I tried to drown the pain away
But my pain learned how to swim
I think about it everyday
I'm want she want but she needs him
How can you basis what was a lie on trust
Strangers now lovers in august
Mist fills my lungs
Save me while I'm still young
Were lost in the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
