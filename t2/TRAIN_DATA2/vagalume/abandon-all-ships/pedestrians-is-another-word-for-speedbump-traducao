Take one last breath*
You're about to jump to your death
Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door
Captain Captain
Before the sail rips
Gasp for air
ABANDON ALL SHIPS!
The current's strong
the waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding me down
I'm on a cruise to Paradise
I'm done with sin I've paid my price
God is our captain
change your direction
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded
Look what we've built, walking on the plank of guilt
Who parts the sea?
Choose your side
So come with me
You decide
