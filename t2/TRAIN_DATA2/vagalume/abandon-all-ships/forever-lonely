Eventually, you're gonna have to find the hands you trust holding
Honestly, I think she's bluffing so my hand's not folding
We're playing games she's pulling every card
I got something when it gets too hard.
Turn me up when you're feeling low
Stuck on repeat, I'll never go
When you feel alone, put on your headphones
Maybe if we drink too much
Baby we won't think as much
Lately it must get lonely saying we're just friends
Baby don't tap out fight it till it ends
Were playing games, she's putting up her guard
I got something when it gets too hard.
Turn me up when you're feeling low
Stuck on repeat, I'll never go
When you feel alone, put on your headphones
I saw diamonds in her eyes
Oh, I've already tried
The noose around your neck
Will get tighter with every lie.
