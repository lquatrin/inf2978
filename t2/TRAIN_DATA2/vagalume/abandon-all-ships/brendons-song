Help me I can't get out,
I live my life not knowing what it's about.
The stains of guilt on my mind,
Heavens what I want to find.
This is now, that was then,
I want to be born again.
For these and all my past sins I am truly sorry.
The darkness came,
The light fought through,
Mercy is all,
I ask of you. (x2)
Father, Father, please set me free,
From my misery. (x2)
Resurrected we've been told,
We're all made of,
Gold.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death,
Save us
