From the darkest deep of the abyss I come
Marching for intense destruction
Bringing in the hands the unholy vengeance 
Infernal fire burn in me
Forging the sanity
Of my cursed existence
I'm the dawn of the apocalypse 
Hate and pain live in my soul
Repulsing mercy and compassion
Strengthened by the fury
To smash the followers of decay 
Darkness from blood's ritual
Destroys the false savior
Testimony of devil's rebirth
Occult by blessed rites
Untruth of bbenevolence
Desecrated by unholy gods
Satan show me the source of wrath
I can strike Jesus Christ
