They say that you've born to the eternal kidness
And that was conceived by divine grace
That came to finish with the pervertion and evil
And died on the cross to humanity save
The pervertion and evil only start after you came
Because you was only a crazy lier
False saints were with you on your insanity
And the more stupids belived on you
Thieves and corrupts
Now eleited priests
They sellet pieces
Of cloth saying it were yours
The chief of insanity
Now is reigning at home
The pervertion and evil
Only start after you came
