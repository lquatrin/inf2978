Listen to me, you mere mortals
Not through God, not through Satan
But through Me - You will feel the Pain
Taste my gift - The Tribulation
Only one term - One requisition
Endure this torment - 'Till the End
Every firbe of your flesh
Feeling unreal pain
Utter depravity
Ecstatic agony
Give up all your Dreams
Rejoice in the Truth: The Pain
Holiness is never cheap
In the debt of apin you'll sink deep
Good deeds of the Righteous
Impurity of the Cursed
That's the price!
Which path will you choose
The Left or the Right
Will you feel the Torment
Or will your soul be saved?
But there's no way to save your soul
From the fingers of evil that reach for your throat
The Agony within, You can't Escape!
