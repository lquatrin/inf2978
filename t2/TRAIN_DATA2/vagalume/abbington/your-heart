So here I go
I'm stumbling for the words to say
But you don't ever fail to shed your grace on me
So here I am on my knees
And I can't say what you can see in me
But I'll take what grace you'll give
And what did I do to ever merit this?
I guess I'll never know
So I break down
The way I could be, the way I should be now
Reflects the beauty of your heart, your smile, your love
That I'm blessed to have known
I know now that you're the one for me
