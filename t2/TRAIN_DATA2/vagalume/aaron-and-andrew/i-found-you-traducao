Through this window
Everything seems new
The worlds not changing
It's just my view
Spent so much time looking
For what I though was right for me
But it's only when I gave up
That I got what I really need
But I know
It's true
You're the everything
I was missing
The perfect part of me
That I really need
All I've known is new
Because
I found you
Anticipation. Is something new
When you neverhad someone
To look forward to
I though I knew who I was
And who I wanted to be
But my mind just kept wandering
Waiting to let me see
And I know
It's true
And I know
It's true
You're the everything
I was missing
The perfect part of me
That I really need
All I've known is new
Because
I found you
All the things I thought I knew
Everything I thought was true
Changed the day my eyes saw you
They saw you
You're the everything
I was missing
The perfect part of me
That I really need
All I've known is new
Because
I found you
