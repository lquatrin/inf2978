Some people all
About the dolla bill
It's quite a shame that ain't
Really how you oughta feel
It's all the same
Everyday
How you gotta deal
With all the pain
But in time it's gonna heal
We never change for anybody that would just be insane
Light a flame
Rock it back and forth
Let me take you away
With my words
I heard someone kicked
It to the curb
Keep your head held high
Like you're chiefin' on the herd
It's absurd the way
The dolla bill rules life
Two types of people
On this earth
Who's right?
One side's controlled
By material things
The others live for experience
and everything it brings
I'm the king of the latter
Sing about what matters
At the ball park with my friends
Swing batta batta
Just another summer's day
Watch the sun fade away
All I gotta say
Is we'll never change
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the wave's curl, hey
No plans
But a drink in my hand
No shoes
No shirt
Swimsuit
Raybans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding
Come on baby girl, water's fine, just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes
We're just livin' in paradise
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Swear we'll never change
So come with me, come with me
Beach side's where we're gonna be
Smiling and enjoying the world that we livin' in
Party in an island somewhere in the Caribbean
Somewhere tropical, underneath the hot sun
Not a worry in the world we ain't got one
Shot gun
Another brew by the deep blue
Never goin' home
'Cause we really don't need to
I'm feeling irie
Congo line right behind me
We getting lively
Chillin' in hawaii, yeah
Taking shots like kyrie
Take a couple more now you in my league
Come vibe with me, get high with me
I know we don't know each other's names
Where we wanna be
Blue skies and sea
Yeah, we'll never change
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the wave's curl, hey
No plans
But a drink in my hand
No shoes
No shirt
Swimsuit
Ray bans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding
Come on baby girl, water's fine, just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes
We're just livin' in paradise
We're never changing
We'll stay the same and
We'll never change at all
We're never changing
We'll stay the same and
We'll never change at all
Get away from it all not a care in the world
Watch the sun hit the water as the wave's curl, hey
No plans
But a drink in my hand
No shoes
No shirt
Swimsuit
Ray bans
Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding
Come on baby girl, water's fine, just dive in
Ain't a dream so open your eyes
We're just livin' in paradise
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Yeah, we'll never change
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Yeah, we'll never change
