She know what she doin
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doing
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doin
Look at how she move it
I told her "I can love you right"
She asking me to prove it
Told her I'm truist baby
Don't be stuck on stupid
A million dollar men I don't need nobody to sense
The question on my mind
I swear you can be the one
Take it shot at love baby you don't need a gun
In the meantime I'm stressed out
Being doing things I don't usually do
But that's the issues with you
I thought I could play it so cool
Look at what she've done to me
My mind throwed
I'm subways
I've been thinking about you and me
Cause I ain't been to sleep in like nine days
It gets reckles in six seconds
That's word up to my Vine page
Don't think of me it's just Ac
Cause I'm worth more than my Vine page
She know what she doin
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doin
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
Come on girl you know exactly what you gotta do
If he don't love you like I can then you gotta move
I know scared cause he hurt you
And broke your heart in two
But not this time, the grass in greener on this side
And Okay, you move
It's all on you
I just want to be next up
And if you chose me we'll blessed up
And I'm so confused
What can I do to trynna make you understend
You don't need another man
So original couldn't copy if you had ten clones
Even if I had ten homes I'd live in the friendzone
This is right where you belong
Queen, you'd never de-throned
And if you know a few dance moves
Baby this is your song
She know what she doin
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doing
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doin
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doing
I can see when the song comes on
She know how move it
I've been waiting on her all night long
She know what she doing
