I,ve got my own good reasons for bringing you down
It's not the first time that I've tried to drag youa round
But for the record let me say that I was wrong
It's not the same that you would have gone
And I think it's obvious from hearing people talk
You'd do whatever just to keep yourself in front
But don't get nervous when you're getting what you want
I'm only telling you in case that's what you thought
Oh I'm just a little too proud
You're just a little high off the ground
But I don't want you thinking
We'll always be descending
You and me
Just wait and see
I squeezed a stupid word you put it inside your coat
Istarted off alright but I ended up in smoke
I try to tell you something but I always seem to choke
Oh I guess that's just the way it is it's the only thing
That works
Oh I'm just a little too proud
You're just a little high off the ground
But I don't want you thinking
We'll always be descending
You and me
Just wait and see
And I won't get angry any more
Still stupid people prove me wrong
So grab my hand take me home
Well I'm alright, cat's just got my tongue
Oh I'm just a little too proud
You're just a little high off the ground
But I don't want you thinking
We'll always be descending
You and me
Just wait and see
