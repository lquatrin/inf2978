Tell me: how's a guy like me
Supposed to get through this?
How'd I end up like a fucking tourist?
I'm shouldering the sun just to get noticed
Well, I'm over it
I've done all I can, I think I've earned it
Give me back my pain, I want to burn it
And how come everybody makes me nervous?
I don't wanna fight with you anymore
Sun's on my back now, I'm moving on
I don't wanna fight with you anymore
Any more
Than I have to
Well, screw this
Take another bomb, this time I insist
I can prove you wrong, I have a witness
I'll wait until you're gone before I blow a kiss
'cause I'm over it
I've done all I can, I think I've earned it
Give me back my pain, I want to burn it
And how come everybody makes me nervous?
'cause I don't wanna fight with you anymore
The sun's on my back now, I'm moving on
I don't wanna fight with you anymore
Any more than I have to
