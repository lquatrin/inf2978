Made of Wood
My shoes are filling up with rain
You're standing by the window
Like you're looking for something
There's people coming over
They storm across the lawn
They're asking me my name
And I can't figure out the tune
Your eyes are rolling backwards
As the song starts breaking through
A hand upon my shoulder
It's tearing me away
Just a Sunday afternoon
Another Sunday afternoon
Believe me, if I could do this better I would
Believe me, it wouldn't make any difference if I could
I'm hopeless, I'm obsessed, I'm made of wood
Dark shadows move around your room
Thunder claps against the ceiling mutsmutts start howling at the moon
A key twists in the doorknob then a look lands on your face
This is happening too soon
As the teeth of your family bare
Good people don't do nothing but there's something in their stare
I only wanna love you if you just give me a chance
I can get us out of here
I can get us out of here
Believe me, if I could do this better I would
Believe me, it wouldn't make any difference if I could
I'm hopeless, I'm obsessed, I'm made of wood
I'm hopeless, I'm obsessed, I'm made of wood
