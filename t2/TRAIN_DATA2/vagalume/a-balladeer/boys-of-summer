Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know that you're not home
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
Your got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boy of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow
And you're smiling at everyone
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today
I saw a dead head sticker on a cadillac
A little voice inside my head said: don't look back
You can never look back
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but
But I can see you
You got that top rolled down
And that radio on
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back
And those wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
