We met at redhead Mary's house
On a Bible study night
I heard she was a rebel
Once until she saw the light
Then in the backseat of a crowded car
After weeks of holding hands
She was slipping me the tongue
Among her Christian friends
We could chuckle and talk for hours
And then one night over the phone
She went and told me her best friend's secret
After she had lowered her tone
It was all about forgiving and so
She thought that God would want me to know
Her older sisters had both moved out
And her parents were divorced
Her mother lived in a trailer park
Not big, but she had a porch
And on top of the piano
Laid a cat with evil paws
Her father he was a proud Nam vet
I think she hardly saw
We would chuckle and talk for hours
And then one night over the phone
She went and told me her best friend's secret
After she had lowered her tone
It was all about forgiving and so
She thought that God would want me to know
The old piano she could play so nice
She had later sadly sold
The money was invested in
The church her husband owned
She had a kid when I looked her up
And another on the way
And when we waved our last goodbye
She said that she would pray
