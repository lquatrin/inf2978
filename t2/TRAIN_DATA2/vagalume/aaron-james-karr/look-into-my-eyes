I can see you lookin' at me 
Out of the corner of my eyes 
But every time that I turn to see 
You look away, and then my heart wants to cry 
(Pre-Chorus) 
I don't wanna lose what we share, believe me I 
I Still wanna be your best friend 
But if, anybody gets to be there, let it be me and I 
I won't let this end 
(CHORUS) 
Look into my eyes - You don't ever have to look away 
No need to disguise - tell me what you wanted to say 
There'll be no surprise - both been waitin for this day 
Look into my eyes, Look into my... 
The eyes are the windows to the soul 
And that's why yours are so pretty to me, yes indeed 
we've gotta take this nice and slow, 
And we've got time, but you gotta be honest with me 
(Repeat Pre-Chorus and CHORUS) 
I know it's crazy but baby your spirit 
Just brings me closer to you 
My heart is beating so fast I can hear it just 
Tell me that you feel this way too. Oh.... 
(Repeat CHORUS x2 - below) 
You don't ever have to look away 
(Your eyes are the window to the soul) 
No need to disguise - tell me what you wanted to say 
(we've gotta take it nice and slow) 
There'll be no surprise - both been waiting for this day 
Look into my eyes 
You don't ever have to look away 
(Just stop looking away) 
No need to disguise - tell me what you wanted to say 
(Please just tell me you'll stay) 
There'll be no surprise -both bee waiting for this day 
Look into my eyes
