I spent another night
Wondering why do I need to lie
Pretending I would miss you all the time
Please tell me why
I still allow my eyes to cry
Everytime I recall the day
When we first met
Trying to forget a girl like you

Once upon a time
I wish I'd asked you for a dance
The night we had our last romance
Then maybe we would still be dancing
Oh...........
If I'd asked you one more time
If you would be my valentine
Then maybe you would still be mine

I often dream of you
Like a fool dreams you're lonely too
Recall the love that we once knew
Can't tell you why
I won't allow this dream to die
Everytime I recall the day when we first met
Trying to forget a girl like you
It's hard to do

Once upon a time
I wish I'd asked you for a dance
The night we had our last romance
Then maybe we would still be dancing
Oh...........
If I'd asked you one more time
If you would be my valentine
Then maybe you would still be mine
