Lately, I'm not who I used to be
Someone's come and taken me
Where I don't wanna go
If I knew
Exactly what I have to do
In order to be there for you
When you are feeling low
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can't revive it
All the love we left.....

Everytime I kiss
I feel your lips
And everytime I cry
I see you smile
And everytime I close my eyes
I realise
That everytime I hold
your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart
could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day
I gave your love away

Save me
I've fallen from my destiny
You and I were meant to be
I've thrown it all away
Now you're gone
It's time for me to carry on
But baby I just can't go on
Without you by my side
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now I know we can't revive it
All the love we left...

Everytime I kiss
I feel your lips
And everytime I cry
I see you smile
And everytime I close my eyes
I realise
That everytime I hold
your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart
could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day
I gave your love away

We can survive it
all the pain we feel inside
You relied on me
And now I've let you down
And now I promise you forever
I will be the best I can
Now I know we can't revive it
All the love we left....

Everytime I kiss
I feel your lips
And everytime I cry
I see you smile
And everytime I close my eyes
I realise
That everytime I hold
your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart
could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since I gave your love away

Everytime I kiss
I feel your lips
And everytime I cry
I see you smile
And everytime I close my eyes
I realise
That everytime I hold
your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart
could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day
I gave your love away
