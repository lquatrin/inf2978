She's into superstitions

Black cats and voodoo dolls

I feel a premonition

That girl's gonna make me fall

She' into new sensations

New kicks in the candle light

She's got a new addiction

For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off

And go dancing in the rain

She'll make you live her crazy life

But she'll take away your pain

Like a bullet to your brain



Chorus

Upside inside out

She's livin la vida loca

She'll push and pull you out

Livin la vida loca

Her lips are devil red

And her skins the colour of mocha

She will wear you out

Livin la vida loca

She's livin la vida loca



Woke up in new york city

In a funky cheap motel

She took my heart

And took my money

She must have slipped me a sleepin pill

She never drinks the water

And makes you order

French champagne

Once you've had the taste of her 

You'll never be the same

Yeah she'll make you go insane



Repeat chorus

She'll make you take your clothes off

And go dancin in the rain

She'll make you live her crazy life

But she'll take away your pain

Like a bullet to the brain

Upside inside out

She's livin la vida loca

She'll push and pull you out

Livin la vida loca

Her lips are devil red

And her skins the colour of mocha

She will wear you out

Livin la vida loca

She's livin la vida loca



Upside inside out

She's livin la vida loca

She'll push and pull you out

Livin la vida loca

Her lips are devil red

And her skins the colour of mocha

She will wear you out

Livin la vida loca

Livin la vida loca

Livin la vida loca

Livin la vida loca
