(BEN) 

Sunday morning,time to say goodbye

But i'll be hurrying soon

Though Im leaving

Girl don't start to cry

I'll be thinking of you, yeah..



(PAUL)

It's a lonely ride on a midnight train

I'm counting down the days til I'm home again



(BEN)

How can i sing when my words have run dry

How can i smile with a tear in my eye

Summer's so lost with rain in June

That's how it feels when I'm missing you.

Ohhh yeahhh.. hey baby ooh oooh



(MARK)

No time healing 

Another week gone by

Girl, It feels like a year

Hmmm...

I've been calling every day and night

How i wish you were here

Ohh yeah



(PAUL)

It's a lonely ride on the midnight train

I'm counting down thw days til I'm home again



(BEN)

How can I sing when my words have run dry

How can I smile with a tear in my eye 

Summer's so lost with rain in June

That's how it feels when I'm missing You.



(CHRISTIAN)

Can't wait  to see you again oooh

And you know that I'll be dreaming to this

Oh my baby...



(BEN)

Summer's so lost with rain in June
