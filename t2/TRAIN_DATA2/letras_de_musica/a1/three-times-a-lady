thanks for the times that you've given me
the memories are all in my mind.
and now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
there's something i must say out loud

your once, twice, three times a lady
and i love you...
yes your once, twice, three times a lady
and i love you... i love you...

when we are together the moments i cherish
with every beat of my heart
to touch you, to hold you
to feel you, to need you
there's nothing to keep us apart

your once, twice, three times a lady
and i love you... i love you...
