Sunday mornin',

It's time to say goodbye,

But I'll be home real soon,

Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry,

I'll be thinkin of you.



It's a lonely ride on the midnight train,

I'm countin' down the days 'till I'm home again.



How can I sing when my words have run dry?

How can I smile with a tear in my eye?

Summer's so lost when it's raining in June,

That's how it feels, when I'm missing you.



Now time ain't healin', 

Another week gone by,

Girl it feels like a year,

I've been callin',

Every day and night,

How I wish you were here.



It's a lonely ride on the midnight train,

I'm countin' down the days 'till I'm home again.



How can I sing when my words have run dry?

How can I smile with a tear in my eye?

Summer's so lost when it's raining in June,

That's how it feels, when I missin' you.



Never found a girl who was so damn sweet,

Can't wait to see you again,

Never had a lover that was so complete,

And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'till then, ooh my baby.



How can I sing when my words have run dry?

How can I smile with a tear in my eye?

Summer's so lost when it's raining in June,

That's how it feels, when I'm missin' you.



Summer's so lost when it's raining in June,

That's how it feels when I'm missin' you.
