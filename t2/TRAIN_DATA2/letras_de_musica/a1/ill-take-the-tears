Don't speak, seal your lips,
please don't say a word
maybe I won't remember the words I have not heard
I see that you're in love, I know it's not with me
but I don't want the truth to haunt my memory

It's never too late to relight the fire
it never stopped burning for me
the flame, it never died inside of me

How is it now that I can tell you I love you
How is it only now that it's too late
What can I do, the love that we had is torn in two
so you'll take the smiles from all of our years , I'll take the tears

I sit and reminisce, of times that we once shared
I gave you more than love
You never thought I cared
my feelings were all for you
although it did not show
I only told you on the day you let me go

It's never too late to relight the fire
it never stopped burning for me
The flame, it never died inside of me

How is it now that I can tell you, I love you
How is it only now that it's too late
what can I do, the love that we had is torn in two
so you'll take the smiles from all of our years
and I'll take the tears

Now I realise that your no longer mine
but I'm hoping the pain will heal in time
although your leaving, I won't say goodbye
because I know your here with me inside

How is it now that I can tell you i love you
how is it only now that it's too late
What can I do the love that we had is torn in two
so you'll take the smiles from all of our years
and I 'll take the tears
