Mark: Oh oh…oh yeah yeah..
Where have you been all of my life?
Where have you come from?
Is this your first time too?
It’s like I’ve known you
In some other lifetime
We’re part of a great plan
Like two stars that shine

Chris: I stood here watching
While it only ever happen to friends
Now I don’t have to pretend

Ben: Oooh…
I can’t believe we’re living the dream
We’re diggin’ that scene
We finally made it through the fire
Somethin' 'bout you blows me away
Like night over day
We’re kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah

True love true love
Could this be
True love true love (baby)

Mark: I’ve been waiting all of my life
Anticipating with every dream every night
Destiny's a moment
We all share in time
Love is a message
I know, I know I’ve got mine

Chris: I stood here watching
While it only ever happened to friends
Now I don’t have to pretend

Ben: Ooohh…
I can’t believe we’re living the dream
We’re diggin’ that scene
We finally made it through the fire (Mark-made it through the fire)
Something 'bout you blows me away
Like night over day
We’re kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah

True love true love
Could this be
True love true love baby
Happy, loneliness goodbye
True love true love
Could this be
True love true love
Happening to me

Ben: I can’t believe we’re living the dream
We’re diggin’ that scene
We finally made it through the fire
Something 'bout you blows me away
Like night over day
We’re kissing the loneliness goodbye
Yeah
(goodbye…)

True love true love
Baby could this be
True love true love
Happening to me
True love true love
Baby could this be yeah

Ben: True love true love
Finally happening to me….
