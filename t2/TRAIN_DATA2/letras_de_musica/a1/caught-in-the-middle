You said that love was just a state of mind

A puzzle made of pieces you can't find

But for me you never really had the time

I was blind, oooohhh.



And everything that you meant to me

Is written in the pages of my history

But it's over now as far as I can see

Suddenly



Chorus:

Things are so different now you're gone

I thought it'd be easy I was wrong

(and now I'm caught..)

And now I'm caught in the middle

Even though  I am with someone new

All I can think about is you

(and now I'm caught...)

And now I'm caught in the middle



Movin' on she brings me brighter days

Thoughts of you are in my mind always

Like a memory, that I can't erase

It's here to stay



Chorus:

Things are so different now you're gone

I thought it'd be easy I was wrong

(and now I'm caught..)

And now I'm caught in the middle

Even though  I am with someone new

All I can think about is you

(and now I'm caught...)

And now I'm caught in the middle



(So different)So different

(So easy)So easy

(But I can't get over you) And I can't get over you x2



Chorus: (x2)

Things are so different now you're gone

I thought it'd be easy I was wrong

(and now I'm caught..)

And now I'm caught in the middle

Even though  I am with someone new

All I can think about is you

(and now I'm caught...)

And now I'm caught in the middle  



Things are so different now you're gone

I thought it'd be easy I was wrong

And now I'm caught in the middle

Even though  I am with someone new

All I can think about is you

And now I'm caught in the middle
