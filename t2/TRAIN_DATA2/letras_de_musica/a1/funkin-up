Groovin' on to me
I can hear you baby
'Cos we've been here once before
Yeah I can feel the beat
Don't you feel it baby
And it makes me want you more
Didn't you tell me yesterday
We gotta take it all the way
Yeah
We're funkin' up and I like it
Now you're gettin' hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' up and I like it
Now you're burning up
Never gonna stop
'Cos I like it
Whoa oh
Don't you know I like it
Whoa oh
and now you're close to me
Got to move together
And I've never felt so sure
Your sexuality
I need a love hangover
the rhythm of your body is the only cure
Carried away like butterflies
Feelin' the music takes you high
you know
(*Repeat x2)
'Cos I like it
Whoa oh
Don't you know I like it
Whoa oh
I like it
Whoa oh
Don't you know I like it
I like it
Funkin'
And baby you know
(*Repeat x2)
