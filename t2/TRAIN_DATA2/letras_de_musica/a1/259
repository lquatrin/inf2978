Sunday Football I got boot off the pitch

Some people gamble as a way to get rich

I got to find a better way to invest in zeroes

They say that rent may damage your wealth

I'd rather save it all to spend on myself

I got a letter of eviction and I'm no hero



Bridge

I'm not a saver I'm a spender

I'm a one weekender



Chorus

What can we do when our two worlds collide

there's only ten ways to survive all the chances of  knowing

After a hard day at work I go home

I don't know where I'm going but I'm ready to go

I made a lot of money but got nothing to show

And now it's 2:59

and I'm still waiting for the train to go home



I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of life

Plenty of butter but I don't have a knife

Sure beats the hell out of waiting for a ticket to Rino

Watching Tv makes me really upset

I wonder why I haven't been on it yet

I'm still waiting for a part in a Tarantino



Bridge



Chorus



Yeah i said i wanna go home



What can we do when our two worlds collide

ahhhhhhhhh

After a hard day at work i go home

I don't know where I'm going but i'm ready to go

I made alot of money but got nothing to show

And now it's 2:59 and I'm still waiting for the train to go home

Yeah I'm waiting for the train to go home
