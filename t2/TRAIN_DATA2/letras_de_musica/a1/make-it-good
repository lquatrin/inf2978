pre chorus:

paul

when youre weary 

when your down and out

lay your hands on me

(repeat 2x)



ben

i count my shit

i think of all i have

she never thought about it

then threw it all away



ben

left it all a chance 

she tore down fences

now it seems so wasted

wish she could turn back time



chorus:chris

now she's down on her knees to pray

begging please make it good 

make it good somehow

she will do what it takes to change

someone please make it good 

make it good somehow

someone please



when youre weary 

when youre down and out 

lay your hands on me



ben 

she had a vision 

time to make a stand

for all she used to be 

to turn her life around



ben

to take back yesterday

is never easy

when youre on your own

it seems imposible, so

(reapeat chorus)



mark

welcome to youre revolution

what you dream is what you see 

there's no rules no regulations 

let the music set you free

(repeat chorus)

(repeat pre chorus 2x)
