I can still remember the time you were there

When I needed to hold you, feel you

Everytime I ask you to find a new way

You lie a new way

Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



You said you'd changed

But I'm afraid

It's something I won't live to see

It seems so strange

That sometimes fate

Can appear to be so real and

Yet turn out to be a fantasy



Same old lie

One more time

Say you're gonna be there for me

Say you'll change

Change your ways

You're never gonna keep your promises



Same old game

You know it doesn't turn me on

Brand new day

Singing that same old song

No more lies

If you don't wanna find me

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



Chorus:

Another night, another day

What can I say

You're still the same old brand new you

You break your promises in two

What can I do

When you're the same old brand new you



Because of you

I guess we're through

Is this the way it has to be

I've been a fool (I've been a fool)

A fool for you (a fool for you)

But I've got better things to do than

Let you walk all over me



Same old lies

One more time

Say you're gonna be there for me

Say you'll change

Change your ways

You're never gonna keep your promises



Same old game

You know it doesn't turn me on

Brand new day

Singing that same old song

No more lies

If you don't wanna find me

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



Chorus:

Another night, another day

What can I say

You're still the same old brand new you

You'll break your promises in two

What can I do (what can I do)

When you're the same old brand new you



I can still remember the time you were there

When I needed to hold you, feel you

Everytime I ask you to find a new way

You lie a new way

Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



Same old lies

One more time

Say you're gonna be there for me (there for me)

Say you'll change

Change your ways

Never gonna keep your promises



Same old game

You know it doesn't turn me on

Brand new day

Singing that same old song

No more lies

If you don't wanna find me

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone



Chorus:

Another night, another day

What can I say (what can I say)

You're still the same old brand new you

You break your promises in two (what can I do)

What can I do

When you're the same old brand new you
