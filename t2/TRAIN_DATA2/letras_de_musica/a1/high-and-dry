(ben)

maybe i don't even exist

so i'll stay anonymous

it's over and the situation shouted in shame

and they say it's down to us

but what do they know

(all)

so write, this time

till it's starting or ending

i'll never get tired of your lies



(ben)

but what you've got to visualise

(all)

it's so intoxicating

we either get it high or go dry

(ben)

either get it high or go dry

this time



(paul) 

i see you're playing that song again

you never show your hand 

to let me in



(paul) you keep it all inside yourself

and cry to no one else

but i catch your tears



(all)

so i write

(ben)

so i write,this time

this time



till it's starting or ending(ben:starting)

i'll never get tired of your lies



(paul)

but what you've got to visualise(ben:oh, oh)

(all)

it's so intoxicating

we either get it high or go dry

either get it high or go dry

(paul)either get it high or go dry



(mark)

you say this love will see another day

but at least tonight

you'll be mine



(all)

so i write(mark:so i write),this time (mark:this time)

till it's starting or ending (mark:starting or ending)

i'll never get tired of your lies (mark:oh, oh)



(paul)

but what you've got to visualise

we either get it high or go dry

either get it high or go dry
