Ben: And as I look into your eyes
I see an angel in disguise
Sent from god above
For me to love
To hold and idolise

Ben: And as I hold your body near
I'll see this month through to a year
And then forever on
Till life is gone
I'll keep your loving near

Ben: And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load

Ben: You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You opened door that closed
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose

Ben: And when I feel like hope is gone
You give me strength to carry on
Each time I look at you
There's something new
To keep our loving strong

Ben: I hear you whisper in my ear
All of the words I long to hear
Of all you'll always be
Here next to me
To wipe away my tears

Ben: And now I've finally found my way
To lead me down this lonely road
All I have to do is follow you
To lighten off my load

Ben: You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You opened door I closed
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose

Ben: And though the seasons change
Our love remain the same (Just like a rose)
You face the thunder
When the sunshine turns to rain
Just like a rose (Oh...)

All: You treat me like a rose
You give me room to grow
You shone the light of love on me
And gave me air so I can breathe
You opened door I closed
In a world where anything goes
You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose

Ben: You give me strength so I stand tall
Within this bed of earth
Just like a rose
