Verse 
I hear the coyotes calling
Their melancholy pierces the night
I feel those wheat fields waving
Calling me with their collective spite
I know tomorrow morning
Fate will dictate my part
But I never believed in fate
A
Because I know the coyote's heart

You're 200 miles away

On the other side of the state

And I'm going round and round in a wheat field

Trying to beat the rain
The sun goes down; it won't matter much

We'll keep on cutting 'till the straw gets tough

I'll be free when we get through

I'll head back to town and back to you 
Outside the chaff is blowing
Inside my muscles ache
Outside the sun is setting
In it I see your face
I'll be damned if I leave
Before the harvest moon assumes a crescent shape
I'd hit the road with the hammer down
If only I could these fetters break
I see the storm clouds rolling
Oklahoma's gift: the rain
I see the weather, unlike you,
Never minded the grain
The squall line across the field moves
Just like your life crossed mine
As I roll the tarp I think
I should have been done in time
