God may be an astronaut
Oz is over the rainbow
Fairytales are only make believe
Tell me where do the monsters play

TheyÂ’ve only got a million miles to go
The final frontier brings a brand new foe
Galactic race has the space for you
The special sauce in the human stew
EARS, ARMS, & EYES
HANDS, FEET, & THIGHS

Oz is owned by astronauts
Fairytales are full of rainbows
God may be only make believe
Tell me where do the monsters prey
