Did you get lost? didnÂ’t you know notice
The same way you got here my dear is the only way out
Do you need a friend? would you like a warm fire?
Settle right down here my dear Â‘cause thereÂ’s no need to cryÂ… oh no
DonÂ’t be so startled my dear causeÂ’ your not going to dieÂ…
Not yet
The dreams arenÂ’t so bad here my dear if you just close your eyes
Â“close my eyes?Â”... Â“why?Â”

Did you stray from the path my friend, did you follow the road
The road to ruin again, has fate forebode
Fantasy aint your luxury, this aint your game
Ecstasy and your company pride lost in the rain

Try or die - you should know - itÂ’s the only way outta here
Fight or cry - itÂ’s quite a show - why donÂ’t you face your fear
Try or die - this is the way to go - itÂ’s the only way outta here
Fight or cry Â– itÂ’s nice nÂ’ warm below - why donÂ’t you face your fear

It seems you lost your way again, maybe itÂ’s time to give up
After all whatÂ’s this journey worth when the going gets rough
Have a seat weÂ’ll negotiate a way out for you
Just sign right here and iÂ’ll give you my word i see that your through

Â“come, come right in my dear, welcome childÂ”
Â“how was your trip?Â”
Â“okÂ”
Â“pssssst, iÂ’ve got something for youÂ”
Â“huh?Â”
Â“follow me, iÂ’m sure youÂ’ll find it as a nice surpriseÂ”
Â“oh my god...no!Â”
Â“how about a little treat my dearÂ”
Â“ha ha ha ha ha haÂ”
