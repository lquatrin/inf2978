Violence! the language of the human race
Silence! the masses are the missiles in place
The end! of reason is the one last resort
Defend! existance as we plunge into war
M. a. d.

Invade! and conquer like a thousand times before
Repeat! the history have we learned nothng more
Bodies! and enemies on the television news
Harvest! the ratings and the battle ensues
M. a. d. mutually assured destruction

Destroy! tomorrow won't admit our defeat
Distort! our sorrow we've beaten the week
Looser' s! and orphans feed a rage that will grow
Celebrate! the hate until the next violence show
M. a. d.
