Part hell, part human, part Al Capone
Half man, half beast, lock stock and gone
He doesn't take orders but he's taking over
Lightning bolts stamped into his revolver

He's the heart of organized crime
Collecting organs and it's pay back time
Well it's the same damn thing each and every day
Working for the mob in an angry way

Frankenstein Mobster's on a killing spree
He's going to settle some business with the family
Frankenstein Mobster's on a killing spree
He's going to settle some business with the family
You better pay up cause there's really no need to fight
You better pay up or he'll cash in on your life

Love dead hate living aint half alive
Shut up, get in for a little drive
There's a bullet with your name as the chamber turns
You used to talk big now your sleeping with worms

Loves the cheating, loves the beating
Loves the stealing and killing who said romance is dead
Loves the cheating, loves the beating
Loves the stealing and killing who said romance is dead
Romance aint dead
