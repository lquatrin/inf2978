Is it hard to go on
Make them believe you are strong
Don't close your eyes
All my nights felt like days
So much light in every way
Just blink an eye
I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly
All your smiles, all is fake.
let me come in, I feel sick,
gimme your arm
From the shadow, to the sun only one
Step and you'll burn
Don't stay too high
I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly
Is it why in your tears,
I can smell the taste of fears
ItÂ’s all around
All my laughs, all my wings
They are graved inside your ring
You were all mine
I used to be someone happy
You used to see that I'm friendly
