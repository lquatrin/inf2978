Every time I touch you
my heart skips a beat.
Every time I kiss you
I feel love from my head to my feet.
Somethin' deep within me, baby,
sayin' you should be mine.
Don't you know, baby, somewhere
I got to, I got to draw the line?

Tell me, baby, whose side are you on?
Are you wih me, or am I all alone?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, baby,
oh, where you been so long?
Since I need you,
oh, won't you please come ho-ome?

And every mornin' I wake up,
can't hide my tears.
After all the lovin', baby,
we've had through the years.
It's a lonely season, baby,
for you to leave, leave with no reason, babe.
I just can't help believin'
this time you're really, really, really leavin'.

Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?
Are you with me, or am I all alone?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, baby,
oh, where you been, where ya,
where have you been so long?
Since I need you, woo, come on home!

Whoa, baby, whose side are you on?
Since I need you, oh-oo-oh-ho!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, baby,
where you been, where you been,
where you been so g-ddamn long?
Since I need you,
whoa, honey, honey, come home!
Owwwww!!!!
