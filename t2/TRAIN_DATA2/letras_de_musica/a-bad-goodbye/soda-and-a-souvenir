Don't start talking the poetry, darlin'.
That's not what I wanna hear tonight.
I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.
I want a soda and a souvenir.
Yes, I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.

Don't start whispering the sweet things, darlin'.
Your words are dangerously clear tonight.
I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.
I want a soda and a souvenir.
Just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.

Watch what you say, I'll remember it always.
It's so easy for me to fall.
If only you knew, you might not say anything at all.
And I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.

Don't start singin' them love songs, darlin'.
I believe every word that I hear tonight.
I'm a girl with moonlight in my eyes.
I want a soda and a souvenir.
Yes, I'm just a girl with moonlight in my eyes.
Just a girl with that moonlight in my eyes.
