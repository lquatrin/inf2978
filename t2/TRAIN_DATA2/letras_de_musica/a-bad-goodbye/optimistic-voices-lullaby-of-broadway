You're out of the woods,
You're out of the dark,
You're out of the night.
Step into the sun,
Step into the light,
Then open your eyes
And love will open, ahhh,
Open, ahhh,
Open, open, open, open up.

Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of broadway.
The hip-hooray and balley-hoo.
The lullaby of broadway.

The rumble of the subway train.
The rattle of the taxi.
The daffodils who entertain
At angelo's and maxi's.

When a broadway baby says good night,
It's early in the morning.
Manhattan babys don't sleep tight
Until the dawn.

Good night, baby.
Good night. milkman's on his way.
Doon, doon, doon.
Sleep tight, baby.
Sleep tight. let's call it a day. hey!

Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of broadway.
The hi-de-hi and boop-boop-buh-doo.
It's just the lullaby of broadway.

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy.
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round
'til everything gets hazy.
Hush-a-bye, i'm gonna buy you this and that,
You hear your daddy sing.
Then baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day.

Good night, baby.
Good night. the milkman's on his way.
Do, do, do, doodley-do.
Sleep tight,oh, my baby.
Sleep tight. let's call it a day.

Listen to the lullaby of
Ol-bo-ba-bo-ba-b'old doo doo doo broadway!
The lulla-lullaby of broadway!
