They say everything can be replaced.
That every distance is not near.
So I remember every face
of every man who put me here.

They say every woman needs protection,
then they turn around and tell you
every woman's got to fall.
I swear I see my own reflection
somewhere far beyond this wall.

I see my light come shining
from the west down to the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

Now yonder stands
there in that lonely crowd,
a man who swears he is not to blame, no, no.
And if you ask him has he ever seen this lonely woman,
he'll tell you, "No, no, no."
What's more, he does not know my name!

But I see my light come shining,
shining, shining, shining from the west
straight on down to the east.
Ah-anyday now, any, any old day now,
I am going to, I am going to be released, yeah!

They tell ya, tell ya every woman,
they tell ya every woman
got to have protection,
then they turn around and tell ya,
"No! We gotta make that-a woman fall!"
Oh, god, I swear! I swear I see,
I see my, my very own reflection
far and away beyond, way, way beyond
these old walls!

That's right! I see, I see my light, my light,
my light is shining, shining, shining,
shining, shining, shining, shining
from the west straight on down to the east.
And any day now, do you hear me?
Any day now, I shall be,
I am going to be released!

Any day now, any day now, any day now,
any, any day now, oh, any day now,
any day, any day, any day,
any day, any day, any day,
woah, any day, any day, any old day now,
yeah, any day now
I am going to, I shall be released!

Woah, any day now, I shall see again!
Any day now, I shall be free again!
Any day now, they'll let me be again!
Oh, any day now, any day now, any day now,
whoa, help me, any day, any day,
any old day now . . .
