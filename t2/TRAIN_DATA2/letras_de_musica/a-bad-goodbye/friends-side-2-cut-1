Oh, you got to have friends,
the feeling's oh so strong.
You got to have friends
to make that day last long.
Had some friends, but they're gone,
somethin' came and took them away,
and from the dusk 'til the dawn
here's where I will stay.

Standing at the end of the road, boys,
waitin' for my new friends to come.
I don't care if I'm hungry or cold, freezing.
I got to get me some.

'Cause you got to have friends.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Friends.
"Oh, that's the favorite part of my voice, you know.
I really like to get up. Hm."
Oh, friends.
"Thank you."
Oh, friends, friends, friends, friends.
I had some firends, oh, but they're all gone, gone.
Somethin' took 'em away,
and from the dusk 'til the dawn
here is where I'm gonna stay, you know, oh.

Standing at the end of a real long road, Jack,
and I'm waitin' for those new friends to come,
and I don't care if I'm jungry or freezing, freezing cold.
You gotta, you gotta get me some.

'Cause you gotta have,
"you gotta have friends. I'm telling you. I am speaking 'cause I know. 
It's going too fast. We're all going too fast! 
I'm trying to tell you to slow down! 
They're hard to come by! Those friends are hard to come by! 
I didn't have many friends, you know. 
But, things are getting better now. 
And I think it's gonna be okay, 'cause I have a couple now."

Friends,
you gotta, you gotta, you gotta have friends, friends.
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta have friends, friends.
Oh, friends . . .
