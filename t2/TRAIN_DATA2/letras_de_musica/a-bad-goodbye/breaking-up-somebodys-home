I got a funny feelin' that all of you girls
Had better hold on to your man.
'cause i feel, i says i feel,
I feeeeel like breaking up somebody's home.

See, lying here all alone
On a rainy night like this.
Starvin' for some lovin'.
Oh-oh, what i would give,
What i would give for just one kiss.
Every rain drop i hear
Against my window pane.
And it's beatin' through
So loud and clear.
Words, words that speak your name.

See i, i got no where to turn
Now that you have gone,
And i feel like
Breaking up somebody's home.

I know it's useless
Hangin' on when you belong to someone else.
But i can't shake the feelin'.
Oh, after all, i didn't make this bed.
I got nowhere to turn
Na, na, na, now, na, now, now that you have gone.

I saw the boy last night
And i believe i caught a chill.
Well, i could, i could not control the vibration,
And my heart, my heart,
My heart justa would not stand still.
I got nowhere to turn
A now, now, now, now that you have gone,
And i feel like
Breaking up somebody's home.
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run
And i'm so damn tired of being all alone,
And i feel like
Breaking up somebody's home.

I know it's useless
Hangin' on when you, you, you, ya,
You belong to someone else.
But i, la, la, la, can't shake the feeling,
Oh, after all, i didn't want it this way.
I swear i did not want it this way.
But i got nowhere, a no where to run,
And i'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,
And i feel like breaking up somebody's home.
Got nowhere, a nowhere to run,
And i'm so g-ddamned tired of being alone,
And i, i feel like, feel like,
Breaking up some mutha's home.
One more time.
I, i got nowhere to turn,
A nowhere to, nowhere to, nowhere to turn,
And i feel like, i feel like,
Breaking, breaking up somebosy's home.
I gotta break up somebody's home.
