[Rose:] You'll never get away from me.
You can climb the tallest tree.
I'll be there somehow.

True, you could say, "Hey, here's your hat."
But a little thing like that
couldn't stop me now.

I couldn't get away from you,
even if you told me to,
so go on and try.
Just try and you're gonna see
how you're gonna not at all
get away from me.

[Herbie:] Rose, I love you, but don't count your chickens.
[R:] Come dance with me.
[H:] I warn you that I'm no Boy Scout.
[R:] Relax awhile, come dance with me.
[H:] So don't think that I'm easy pickin'.
[R:] The music's so nice.
[H:] Rose, 'cause I just may some day pick up and pack out.
[R:] Oh, no you won't. No, not a chance.
No arguments, shut up and dance.

[R:] You'll never get away from me.
You can climb the tallest tree.
I'll be there somehow.
True, you could say, "Hey, here's your hat."
[R&H:] But a little
[H:] thing like that
couldn't stop me now.

[R&H:] I couldn't get away from you,
even if I wanted to.
[R:] Well, go on and try.
Just try
[H:] Ah, Rose.
[R:] and you're gonna see
[H:] Ah, Rose
[R:] how you're gonna not at all
[R&H:] get away from me.
