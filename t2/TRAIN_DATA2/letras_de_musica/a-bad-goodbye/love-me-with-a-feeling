[Man:] "All right! She's gonna sing!"
[Rose:] "All right, we all turn to page 438. 
Now, you know we all gonna sing along. 
Oh, I do love a revue."

Ohhhhhh!
You know, women don't like this woman,
'cause I always speak my mind.
But the men ain't crazy about me,
'cause I love to take my time.

If you're gonna love this woman,
gotta love me with a thrill,
'cause, baby, if you don't,
I gotta find a man who will.

Love me with a feeling.
You got to love me with a feelin'.
You got to love me with a feelin',
or you don't love me at all.

You know, I'm the kind of woman,
I don't want no halfway stuff.
If you're gonna turn me loose, baby,
be sure I had enough.

You know, the cops once took me in,
but I did not need the bail.
I just shook it for the judge and he,
he put that cop in jail.

You got to love me with a feeling.
You got to love me with a feelin'.
You got to love me with a feelin',
or you don't love me at all.

"All right, Milledge, this one's for you."
There was one cat who could not make it,
and Milledge was his name.
The only cat I ever knew
who left before he came.

There he's a-standing,
drinkin' pop from a paper cup.
But when it's time for gettin' down,
Milledge can not get it up!

You gotta love me with a feelin'.
Yeah, love, love me with a feelin'.
You got to love me with a feelin',
or you can't love me at all.
