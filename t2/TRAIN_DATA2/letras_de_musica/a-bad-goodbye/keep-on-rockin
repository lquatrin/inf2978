You know I been thinkin'
Lord, about the hard sides of rock and roll.
They say you can't make no money,
ooh, unless you're the Rolling Stones.
That put a chip on my shoulder;
gave me the fire in my in my blood.

Children of the Earth,
listen what I say.
You made rock and roll
what it is today.
And no two-bit fascist
is gonna shoot us down.
So come on children,
bring your guns to town.
Shoot 'em down!

We can rock and roll all night long.
And I wanna see you out there feelin' strong.
And I wanna give you, ooh, the shot you need.
I'll be your doctor. You just call on me.
Call on me, baby, baby.
Call on me, call on me, baby.

Keep on rockin'.
Keep on rockin'.
Keep on, rock 'n' roll
gonna never die.
Keep on rockin'.
Keep on rockin'.
Keep on, rock 'n' roll
gonna never die.

Children of the Earth,

Keep on rockin'.
Keep on rockin'.
Keep on, rock 'n' roll
