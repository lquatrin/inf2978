Come on down lightning.
Come on down thunder.
Come on down raindrops.
Don't leave me to wonder.
Life ain't worth loving,
love ain't worth having
without you.

Come on down heartache.
Come on down pain.
Come on down teardrops,
falling like rain.
Life ain't worth loving,
love ain't worth having
without you.

Come on down hurting.
Whoa, that's for certain.
Whoa-o-oh, coming down blind.
Don't it feel like it's skirtin',
and pouring down rain forever more?
Coming down harder than ever before.

Wahhh, blow on in north wind,
blow in the cold.
Losin' my senses;
losin' control.
Whoa, need my baby so bad.
I go crazy without you.

Coming down heavy.
Coming down light.
Coming down daytime.
Coming down all night.
Need my baby so bad.
I go crazy.
Life ain't worth livin',
love ain't worth havin'
without you.

Rainin' down rain,
pourin' down pain
without you.
