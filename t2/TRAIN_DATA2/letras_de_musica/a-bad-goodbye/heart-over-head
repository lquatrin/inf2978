I had a will of iron.
I had a heart of steel.
I always call the shots.
But, honey, you shoot to kill.
I've spent a hundred other nights like this.
A little laughter and a stranger's kiss.

But the next thing that I knew,
I was heart over head
over heart over head over you.
It's too late to stop it now.
I'm heart over head
over heart over head over you.

I never once imagined
a night like this before,
that love would last for hours,
and still I begged for more.
If I sound a little crazy,
well, forgive me, please.
My head is swimmin'
and I'm on my knees

cryin', "Love me, love me, do!"
Because I'm heart over head
over heart over head over you.
Too late to stop it now.
I'm heart over head
over heart over head over you.

Can't seem to slow down.
Can't even touch the ground.
The harder I try,
the higher I fly.

I'm fallin' heart over head
over heart over head over you.
Where did you get your touch?
I'm heart over head
over heart over head over you.
I like it much too much.
Heart over head
over heart over head over you.
Too late to stop it now.
I'm heart over head
over heart over head over you . . .
