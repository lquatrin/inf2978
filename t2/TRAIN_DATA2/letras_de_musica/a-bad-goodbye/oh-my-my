[Harlettes:] She called up the doctor
to see what's the matter.
He said, "Come on over."

[Bette:] I said, "Do I have to?"
My knees started aching,
my wrists started shakin'
when the doctor said to me,

Whoa, he said
Oh my my, oh my my,
can you boogie? Can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my,
you can boogie if you try.
Oh my my, oh my my,
you know it's guaranteed to keep you alive.

Whoa, no no no no no!
Now don't make me go!

[Harlettes:] The head nurse, she blew in
just like a tornado.
When they started dancin'

[Bette:] I jumped off the table.
I felt myself reeling,
and as I was healing,
this is what he said to me,

Ow! Oh my my, oh my my,
can you boogie? Can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my,
you can boogie if you try.
Oh my my, oh my my,
you know it's guaranteed to keep you alive.

[Harlettes:] Can you boogie?
[Bette:] Whoa, my my my my mu mu my mu mu my mu mu my my my my
Can I boogie? Can I boogie? Can I boogie?
Can I boogie woogie?

[Harlettes:] Can you boogie?
[Bette:] Yes I can, yes I can, yes I can.
[Harlettes:] Can you boogie?
[Bette:] Yes I can, yes I can, yes I can.
[Harlettes:] Can you boogie?
[Bette:] Yes I can, yes I can, yes I can.

"Can I boogie? 
Can I boogie? 
What kind of asshole question is that? . . ."
