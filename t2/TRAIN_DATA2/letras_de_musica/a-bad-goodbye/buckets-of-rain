[Bette:] Ohh-oh, Ohh-oh, ah
Sing to me baby, baby.
Buckets, nuggets of rain.

[Bette & Bob:] Nuggets of rain,
nuggets of tears.
Got all the nuggets
comin' out of my ears.
Nuggets of moonbeams
in my hand.
You got all the love,
honey baby, I can stand.

I been down, high like an oak.
I've seen pretty people
disappear like smoke.
Friends will arrive,
friends will disappear.
You want me,
honey baby, I'll be here.

[Bette:] Oh-oh, I'll be here.
Ooooooh.
Sing to me baby, baby, baby.
Buckets of rain.

[Bette & Bob:] I like your smile
and your fingertips.
I like the way that you move your lips.
I like that heavenly way
you look at me.
Everything about you is bringing me ecstasy.

Little red wagon,
little red bike.
I ain't no monkey
but I know what I like.
I like the way you monkey around.
Stick with me baby
and we'll never be found.

Life is heavy
and life is sad.
Life is a bust
when you think you've been had.
You lose, you must do
and you do it bad.
I do it for you,
honey baby, ain't you glad?

[Bette:] Oh, Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooooh.
Bobby, Bobby,
hey there Mister D,
you set me free. Yeah.
I don't believe I really said that.

[Bob:] "Hum, meany."
[Bette:] "Oooh, you don't even know. You have no idea."
[Bob:] "I don't want to know . . . . .
You and Paul Simon should have done this one."
