You could call it a spur the moment type of thing 
You can even curse my name 
Don't take my leaving straight to your heart 
Selfish intentions need a brand new place to start 
Hey baby you could say that I've got plans 
But I'm not gonna make it anywhere in this town as it stands 
I'm jumpin' in hittin' the gas 
Spidometers wrapped and I can't look back 
Ya as much as I want to, I've got dreams 
And I know I said that I wanted you to come 
But you didn't want to leave that job at home 
I know that your feelin' the same thing       
But these dreams are heading down the fastlane 
 
My friends tell me i'd be crazy if I passed it up 
When you know you want it bad enough 
My brother says he knows what the feelings are all about 
If it's meant to be it'll all work out 
Baby you tell me i've got big boots to fill 
So I'm not gonna sit here one more day 
I ain't got time to kill 
 

Baby don't get down 
Don't you worry about me 
You probably think i'm gone for good 
But i'm coming back for you
