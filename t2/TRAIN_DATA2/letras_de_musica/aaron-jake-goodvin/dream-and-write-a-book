Hey girl since i've met you,
It's been a rollercoaster ride
I've been going crazy every time we say goodbye
Even eric startol couldn't explain
The way i feels inside

Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that i am hooked
On your love and irrizistableness
Aint no girl that i'd rather be with
And it probily wont win no prize
But if i can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you

Now i'm no writer and i'm no poet
And i dont have a way with words
So all this mushy stuff may sound a little upserck
But even my friends and i think i'm losing my mind
About the way i feel inside

Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that i am hooked
On your love and irrizistableness
Aint no girl that i'd rather be with
And it probily wont win no prize
But if i can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you

Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that i am hooked
On your love and irrizistableness
Aint no girl that i'd rather be with
And it probily wont win no prize
But if i can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you
Its called loving you
Its called loving you !
