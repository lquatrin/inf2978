This is a tale of a brand new life's tomorrow
Don't give it up, it's a long way to go
Don't let him take your soul
If you are able to do
You've got to escape of the moot
The realms of your past are spacing from you

It's further than anguish
It's up to the truth

He spent his life for all these years, in prison
But in your heart, it feels like the same
And now he's out of cage
You see your son growing strong
Reflecting the care you have done
You better start now it's ten years gone

It's further than anguish
It's up to the truth

It is living inside of you
The lies you're keeping within... oh ....

It's further than anguish
It's up to the truth

It's further than anguish
It's up to the truth

It's further than anguish...
