You make me see the signs that i have told
It's just a taste of hapiness, a trip to an end
Escaping with you, a mirror is what i need
In search of something in my mind, a sight to my fear

I won't forget the visions i had
Givin'me thrill , blowing my head
And so i stand, face to face, with the death
Even with you, i'm carrying the blame , i'm in a trance
Lonely in the dark

You mean to me another destiny
It's just a way i travel to the depths of unknown
It's getting to me, the poison i feel within
The hard time seems to never end
The sky goes to black

So you can throw me down in the streets
I'm living so high , destroyin' myself
I start to spread frozen wings, be your guest
Even with you, i'm carrying the blame, i'm in a trance
Lonely in the dark

You mean to me , the poison i feel within
It's just a taste of hapiness, a void in my head
It's geting to me, a mirror is what i need
The hard times seems to never end
The sky goes to black
I won't forget the visions i had
I'm living so high , destroyin' myself
And so i stare, face to face, be my guest
Even with you, i'm carrying the blame, i'm not the same
Lonely in the dark
