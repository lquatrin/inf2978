chorus:
Hearts telling me no
Body telling me yes
I go with the flow
Let the feeling grow
My hearts telling me no
Body telling me yes
I go with the flow
Let the feeling grow

verse 1:
I don't know
If the words you say are true
I don't know
But I'm anxiously waiting on you
To make your move
Girl, do what you got to do
I'm in the mood
And I'm wanting you
Even though theres somebody else
I can't help myself
My hearts telling me

chorus

verse 2:
When I'm with you
I feel the love,
Surrounding me
And I can't contain
The feelings, that I have
When did love
feel so right, that it was bad
Even though theres somebody else
I can't help myself
My hearts telling me

chorus


bridge: (nicole)
(You like the way it feels
When I touch you
I make your fantasy, real)

I like how it feels
When you touch me
You make my fantasys
Real

(When were together
In the back of your mind
It's forever)

When I'm with you
I'm thinking
In the back of my mind
This time it's forever

(When I say I love you
You get caught up
And you can't escape)

When you say
That you love me
I get caught up
It's no mistake,
That I can't escape


chorus


repeat bridge



(nicole)
Said baby
your hearts telling you no
But your body's telling you yes
Come on and try the best
