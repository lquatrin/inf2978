Show me what you working with
Move like this

Move to the right
Now move to the left
Show me what you working with

Verse 1:
Theres something I want from you
When you hear this
Baby move
Get on up and do
That ass shaking thing
That you do
So lets go
Follow me, baby
Lets get down and dirty
Get crazy

repeat chorus

Verse 2:
Feel it through your bones
Let all the frustration go
[Breathe, Stretch, Shake, Let it go...haha]
Place your eyes on me
And just move your feet
I said I know that
You feel it through your bones
Let all the frustration go
Start of slow
Now speed it up
And oh

When my song start playing
Tell the DJ to rewind that back
When my song start playing
Tell the DJ to rewind that back

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
And move with me, move with me

Move like this

repeat chorus
