From the Island of Manhattan to the coast of gold,
from North to South, from East to West,
You are the love I love the best.
You're the dream girl of the sweetest story ever told;
a dream I've sought both night and day
for years through all the U.S.A.
The star I've hitched my wagon to
is very obviously you 

refrain:
Of thee I sing, baby
summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby
You're my silver lining
you're my sky of blue
There's a love light shining
all because of you 

Of thee I sing, baby
You have got that certain thing, baby!
Shining star and inspiration
worthy of a mighty nation
of thee I sing! 

refrain 

All because of you!
Of thee I sing, baby
You have got that certain thing, baby! 

Shining star of inspiration
Worthy of a mighty nation
Of thee I sing! 

refrain
