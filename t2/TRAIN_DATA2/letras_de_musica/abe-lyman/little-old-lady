Little old lady passing by,
Catching everyoneÂ’s eye,
You have such a charming manner,
Sweet and shy.
Little old bonnet set in place,
And a Smile on your face,
YouÂ’re a perfect picture in your
Lavander and lace.
Little bit of business here,
Little bit of business there,
Bet that youÂ’ve been window shopping
All around the square.
Little old lady, time for tea
HereÂ’s a kiss, two or three,
YouÂ’re just like that little old lady,
I hold dear to me.
