If this all should end
You wouldn't smile so polite
Hands upon the neck
Of every smile you see tonight

And I would play for hours
I would play for hours

Same
It stays the same

I wish it all would end
And I was dragged out on the street
All my former friends
Would feel my blood beneath their feet

And I would play for hours
I would play for hours

Same
It stays the same
Same
It stays just the same

Laughing, Pointing
Laughing, Pointing
