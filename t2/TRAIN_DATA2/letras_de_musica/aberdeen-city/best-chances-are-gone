Walking up and down to stay busy
Look at the river, want to be in her

Try to leave it behind, everyday but
Here she comes again
Another week of mourning
Better, better than just

Keep it honest, a little bit honest
Many years, so many years now

Try to leave it behind, everyday but
Here she comes again
Another week of mourning
Better, better than just

'Hey', 'Hello'
'Let's get together
Today
Or not today'

Try to leave it behind, everyday but
Here she comes again
Another week of mourning
Better, better than just, 'hey'
