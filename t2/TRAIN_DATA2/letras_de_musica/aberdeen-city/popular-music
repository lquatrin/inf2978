Take a small bite of your meat-loaf and share it with the throne
Tie the tie, you're a handsome date rapist

Put some faces, put some smiles, and all that garbage in your mouth
Lick them with the knowledge that you don't know where they've been
Just like a quarter

Fake like you care and you'll get to go home with her tonight
Tell the friends, you're their biggest hero

Put some faces, put some smiles, and all that garbage in your mouth
Lick them with the knowledge that you don't know where they've been
Just like a quarter on the sidewalk

Starving smiles, so pretty
It will always be this way

No one here is innocent
No one here is on his knees
No one here has got some problems
No one here is a rapist, racist, high-blood pressure, short-tempered

Your face has filled out a bit but you're respectable
Keep it sharp, keep on smiling, we're happy

Put some faces put some smiles, and all that garbage in your mouth
Share them with your children though you don;t know where they've been
Just like a quarter on the sidewalk
