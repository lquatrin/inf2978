So you've got something to say
And it won't take very long
The years have given you perspective

I will give you the same length
That it takes to sing this song
Time made me a monster
And not I'm armed

Can't do much like I used to
Can't do what I used to do
But I accept it

I held to hope for years
Or was is only months
So soon I won't remember

But it never went away
I saw it everyday
I gave until my anger
Gave you away
Can't do much like I used to
Can't do what I used to do
But I accept it

It won't take very long
