Flashing that smile at random 
Think youÂ’re right cause youÂ’re handsome 
At least for another seven years 
At least for another seven years 

WonÂ’t fight the face, stand in its place 

Cover yourself when you see them 
To be much safer when you meet again 
Greater numbers are greater judges 
And time has a way of settling grudges 

WonÂ’t fight the face, stand in its place 

And they will stand all day to fight fight fight theyÂ’re fighting for nothing 
And keep it still so they can fight fight fight theyÂ’re fighting for nothing 
And never stop keep up the fight fight fight theyÂ’re fighting for nothing 
And never stop keep up the fight fight fight theyÂ’re fighting for nothing
