I've been shaking hands
He's been taking numbers
All my life

I want to see you cry
I want to hear you talk
It's been quiet for a long time

I lost them all in combat
I sold them out

No one visiting
Is my punishment for
Backing out
Making sounds means making friends these days

I want to see you cry
I want to hear you talk
It's been quiet for a long time

I lost them all in combat
I sold them out
I disappeared in combat
I sold them out
