In the middle of the night you came into their house
Something sinister, cringe when you remember
It shouldn't be this easy to paint away
Hold you for myself

In the middle of her room you came into that bed
Something wonderful to be in here with you once more
It shouldn't be this easy to paint away
Hold me 'till I'm home

And it happened in the same room
I see it written on your little hands, so pleased to meet you
Come right in and feel at home much better this time

In the middle off the night
