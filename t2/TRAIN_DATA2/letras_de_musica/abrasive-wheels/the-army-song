Got my marching orders in the morning post
When I read the letter I thought it was a joke
You gotta fight fight for what you want
You gotta fight fight for what you want
You gotta fight fight for what you want
But why should we fight when the battle is yours
I dont wanna fight in world war three
DonÂ’t wanna fight the japanese
Cos thereÂ’s no honour in dying for the love of your country
And who are you to tell me I gotta fight in a war
It wont be the same as thirty nine in nineteen eighty four
