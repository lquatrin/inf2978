Lying in my bed the thoughts are running through my head
These pills are working and IÂ’m wishing I was dead
ItÂ’s afternoon and the kids are home from school
When I was young I thought that IÂ’d be nobodyÂ’s fool
The summer of Â’76 was hot we spent the whole time drinking
Listening to the Pistols and Ramones thatÂ’s when I got to thinking
I got a guitar and I started up a band
Just another teenage waste, just another punk rock band
Wake up, check it out, this is now, the 21st century
Things never turned out how they planned, like they were meant to be
Wake up, take a look, this is your, 21st century
Everything is pay up on demand, in front of your TV
Out of luck and out of work, I went and spent the giro drinking
Bills ain't getting paid no more and I know this ship is sinking
For what itÂ’s worth, I know I let you down
IÂ’m hanging on the best I can, like a dog about to drown.
Wake up, check it out, this is now, the 21st century
Things never turned out how they planned, like they were meant to be
Wake up, take a look, this is your, 21st century
Everything is pay up on demand, in front of your TV
Times may have changed but the song plays the same
and we all play our part in this mad masquerade 
These are the timesÂ… these are the times of our lives.
