Walk tall walk proud walk the way that you choose
The rebels must think or rebels can only lose
Were right to speak the truth
Were right to speak our minds
Were right were question proof
You want to destroy we want to create
DonÂ’t want us to think just want us to hate
Urban rebel urban rebel urban rebel
We donÂ’t need no guns we donÂ’t need no knives
And we donÂ’t need no one to tell us how to live our lives
Were right to speak the truth
Were right to speak our minds
Were right were question proof
You want to destroy we want to create
DonÂ’t want us to think just want us to hate
Urban rebel urban rebel urban rebel
The people who judge you are the ones with no brains
A world of restrictions all the people are the same
