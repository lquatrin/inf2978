I've got no money to pay my rent
When Friday comes I'm overspent

Life just keeps kicking me down
When I should be out on the town
All the things that I want keep on passing me by
I cant get them out of my mind

I want it
You got it
I need it
I'm gonna take it mutherfucker

The banks are choker, the shops are packed
My pockets are empty and that's a sorry fact

Life just keeps kicking me down
When I should be out on the town
All the things that I want keep on passing me by
I cant get them out of my mind

That girl's so horny, she's teasing me
But what's on offer, it don't come cheap

Life just keeps kicking me down
When I should be out on the town
All the things that I want keep on passing me by
I cant get them out of my mind
