Forgotten youth just waste away 
Sniffing glue to face the day 
Walking streets signing on 
Government schemes go on and on 

[Chorus]
It's no use! 
It's no use! 
It's no use! 

Round and round I'm upside down 
I try to get up, you kick me down 
Vicious circle there's no hope 
Around my neck your like a rope 
Staticians, politicians you feed us crap 
We're all caught up in a rat trap 
Rigmarole on the dole 
Am I alive? I don't know
