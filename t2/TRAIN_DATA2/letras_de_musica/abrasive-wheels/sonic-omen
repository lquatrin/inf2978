The kids have the power in their hands
To venture out across the lands
Guitars loud and voices proud
No-one can crush the wall of sound
Rebels armed with song and verse
Their destiny to scour the earth
Communicating through the airwaves
Are you tuned-in to what they say?

Sonic Omen

So you think its's quiet on these dirty streets
But listen and you'll hear the beat
You'll hear the weapons of the youth
A thousand guitars to speak the truth
Amps and drums in your front room
Is this the answer to the gloom
They have the power fast or slow
To blow the speakers on your radio

Sonic Omen
