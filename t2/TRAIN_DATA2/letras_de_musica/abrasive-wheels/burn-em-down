sitting in a classroom looking into the sky
what am I doing here I dont know why
filling my head with history
when none of it makes any sense to me
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
burn burn burn em down
burn burn burn em down
burn burn burn em down
burn burn
what do you learn when youre at school
only to be everybodys fool
teaching us the way to sign
a wasted generation oh what a crime
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
burn burn burn em down
burn burn burn em down
burn burn burn em down
burn burn
and now from the classroom theyÂ’ve taken our hope
eleven years of learning and I cant cope
useless facts and figures in my mind
but they never taught me of what id find
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
kids dont care about books or rules
all they wanna do is burn the schools
burn burn burn em down
burn burn burn em down
gonna burn burn burn em down
gonna burn burn
