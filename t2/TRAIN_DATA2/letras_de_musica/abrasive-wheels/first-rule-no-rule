Everywhere we go we get pushed around
But why whatÂ’s our crime
Just in the wrong place and at the wrong time
Were always out of line
And all of your restrictions
Could never change what I believe
Contradicting discriminating is making my heart bleed
No rules is the first rule are you too hip to see
You can follow the leaders but donÂ’t dictate to me
Dividing lines unite you Rules to set you free
Contented nothings gonna change the world
However can that be
Becoming the people you want to destroy
By shortening your sight
Judging credibility through your eyes
Why do you think your so right
No rules is the first rule are you too hip to see
You can follow the leaders but donÂ’t dictate to me
