she wrote dear john I love you but all good things must end
IÂ’ve gone to live in Manchester with your best friend
I must have been so nieve I must have been a fool
she must have been two timing me and I never knew
slaughter house slaughter house
I gave her everything that I ever had 
WhatÂ’s he got that I ainÂ’t got its driving me mad
Thrown to the slaughter house for somebody new
IÂ’m gonna break that bitches neck thatÂ’s what IÂ’m gonna do
Slaughter house slaughter house
Now IÂ’m sitting in an empty room with no one as a friend
Just thinking what sheÂ’s doing with him IÂ’m going round the bend
Now all that I think of is getting my revenge
I wonder if they think of me when theyÂ’re in bed
Slaughter house slaughter house
