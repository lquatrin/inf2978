I did it for the wrong reasons
But I donÂ’t care

When I told a good friend I never knew
That some obscure sources would know the truth
Why did you hold it in so long?
You were so cunning to prove me wrong
But now I know that you know

I did it for the wrong reasons
But I donÂ’t care

As the months built up I thought you forgot
Until you called my house and bluntly asked
Why did I do the things I did?
I told you once I never lied

And now your plan worked, I feel so guilty of my sin
Even though I knew that you knew all along

I did it for the wrong reasons
Now I care
