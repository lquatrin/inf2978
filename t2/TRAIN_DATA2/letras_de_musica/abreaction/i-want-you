I wonÂ’t find a peace of mind
If you wonÂ’t ever realize
How much I want you.
I donÂ’t want to sympathize
With all the dramatic, hidden lies
That you think will surround me,

I donÂ’t want the world to see
What the hell you did to me.
I donÂ’t want the world to see
What you meant to me.

My first glance wasnÂ’t as serene
As it was later that week
When holy birds opened the gate.
We were blind but you could see
Is this for real or just a tease
I just need to go away.

I donÂ’t want the world to see
What the hell you did to me.
I donÂ’t want the world to see
What you meant to me.

Everyone has told me to
Stay away from you.
But you have that certain vibe,
IÂ’ve never felt before.
And even though weÂ’ve known each other
For less than one week.
I still want you.
