I donÂ’t know what thereÂ’s to say
The paperÂ’s full of bloody death
People gone people burned
People lost lovers dead
So I sit and stare into my window full of dust
Couples so happy
So why do they die in the end?

Why didnÂ’t I look at your gray eyes?
I donÂ’t need you anyway
Who am I kidding?

You will be here all night
I donÂ’t know exactly what that means, what that means
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
From here I could look at all the beauty gone

Why didnÂ’t I look at your gray eyes?
I donÂ’t need you anyway
Who am I kidding?

Why donÂ’t you go away.
Never come back.
Now itÂ’s better again
Better again.

Will you be here when IÂ’m dead?
Cause IÂ’ll never see you again.
I say goodbye, but youÂ’re already gone.
In a world thatÂ’s so corrupt,
Leaving you is my best option
Turn back time, feel those thoughts
Look away and itÂ’ll be better again.

Why didnÂ’t I look at your gray eyes?
I donÂ’t need you anyway
Who am I kidding?
Who am I kidding?
