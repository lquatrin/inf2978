I never want to give my heart again (2x)

I hold my breath again
this time might be different
but you exaggerate
I guess it's only fate
This leads to all our fights
with you taking my rights
will this ever work out?
I do but you have doubts

I gave you a chance to say 'yes'
After giving my life
You said 'no'

I never want to give my heart again (4x)

I really sympathize 
with your pathetic life
I realize you're cruel
and that I was a fool

I gave you a chance to say 'yes'
After giving my life
You said 'no'

And right at the end
You thought we were friends

I never want to give my heart again (2x)

I never want to give my heart again (2x)
