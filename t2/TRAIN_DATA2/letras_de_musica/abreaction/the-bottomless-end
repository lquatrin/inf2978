Swallowed, in my truth.
I canÂ’t see why this happens to me.
It hurts deep down in my heart.
It hurts deep down in my heart.

In my heart, I feel,
What you mean to me.
Forgotten pride haunts me
With my childhood
It hurts deep down in my heart.
The bottomless end
It hurts deep down in my heart.

Once deprived of love,
Now itÂ’s time to speak.
Life is short, live it long.
I will never lose nothing
Again and again for you
My child, guardian of love
IÂ’ll see that IÂ’ll lose
Never again

It hurts deep down in my heart.
The bottomless end
It hurts deep down in my heart.

I feel so ordinary,
Life is just so plain.
The clocks just tick forever.
Every second lost.
LifeÂ’s too short, live it long
I will never lose nothing
Again and again for you
My child, guardian of love
IÂ’ll see that IÂ’ll lose
Never again

I feel the love,
All the warmth
Guards me, covers me again.

Again, I hear you say
My life is gone.
ItÂ’s not over yet.
By myself,
I will hear my voice,
I will feel my thoughts.
I just want to be me.
I just want to be me.

Swallowed, in my truth.
I canÂ’t see why this happens to me.
It hurts deeps down in my heart.
The bottomless end
It hurts deep down in my heart.

I will live, I will try, I will love, I wonÂ’t die.
I will live, I will try, I wonÂ’t die.
I will live, I will try, I will love, I wonÂ’t die.
I wonÂ’t die
