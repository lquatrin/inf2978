Baby, you donÂ’t understand
When I touched your hand
It was just a touch
It didnÂ’t mean too much
Now IÂ’m ashamed because I want you to feel
The same way that you did before this ordeal

You never told me
What you felt
Unless we were talking
On the phone
And I still feel that you were to blame

You never gave me signals
Was I to read your mind?
And I think you deceived me
Society looks down on me again because of you

Years ago, we were the only ones who talked in the same group
And now we treat each other like we are old enemies

Maybe we should stay apart
Even though weÂ’re friends
It shouldnÂ’t be too hard
Until this nonsense ends
Now IÂ’m ashamed because I want you to feel
The same way that you did before this ordeal

You never told me what you felt
Unless we were talking on the phone
And I still feel that you were to blame

You never gave me signals
Was I to read your mind?
And I think you deceived me
Society looks down on me again because of you

Years ago, we were the only ones who talked in the same group
And now we treat each other like we are old enemies

Time after time
I give up
I need you around
To make me feel loved
