The sun is out
The clouds are blue
I never seen it look so good
I have one question and itÂ’s that
Why do you occupy my mind?

I thought this was under control
I thought this was under control
And I stand here waiting for a sign
From the angels above
Do you still think of me? Think of me

Talking outside on the grass
I felt the time went way too fast
The master plan will never work
If I keep messing up like this

I thought this was under control
I thought this was under control
And I stand here waiting for a sign
From the angels above
Do you still think of me?

I'm not giving up quite yet
I worked on this too long
Every time that we converse
You seem so occupied
I have no tricks up my sleeve
Except to be just me
And I don't think that will even work

Perhaps this is a waste of time
Nothing really seems to rhyme
Another week with no results
I can't tell if it is my fault

I thought this was under control
I thought this was under control
From the angels above
Do you still think of me?
Think of me
