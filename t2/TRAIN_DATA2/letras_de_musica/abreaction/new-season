The spring air makes me alive
The rain washes away
IÂ’m given another chance
But I hope the leaves donÂ’t die in the end 

WhatÂ’s the use in surviving?
If weÂ’ll only lose the fight

Thanks for the experience
One timeÂ’s not enough
I learned a lot through your actions
It never was so opposite

Right now I still feel lonely
But a new season will come

And now the leaves are dying
The winter air is here
I knew that this would happen
But not so soon

WhatÂ’s the use in surviving?
If weÂ’ll only lose the fight

Thanks for the experience
One timeÂ’s not enough
I learned a lot through your actions
It never was so opposite

Right now I still feel lonely
But a new season will come 

I want to breathe, the fresh air again
But the time has passed
So I will enjoy this, fresh winter air
Until the new season

Right now I am indifferent
I never felt so warm before
