I see the light,
It blinds my eyes.
I hide in my closet,
To hide from me

You and I would live forever,
You and I would be.
You and I would live forever,
You

Teach me
Save me
Care me
Hate me

You said too much
Too much for me
IÂ’d see in your eyes
On why you would lie

You and I would live forever,
You and I would be.
You and I would live forever,
You

Teach me
Save me
Care me
Hate me

I see the light,
It blinds my eyes.
I hide in my closet,
To hide from me

You and I would live forever,
You and I would be.
You and I would live forever,
You

Teach me
Save me
Care me
Hate me
