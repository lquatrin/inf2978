Everything seems wrong tonight, because
I feel like I should have some more esteem.
Anxious to give up so readily,
Desperate to wake up and try anything
Feels like IÂ’m innerly confused
About the way people think of others.
NothingÂ’s closely knit to my own views.
When youÂ’re feeling down just think ofÂ…

EveryoneÂ’s going to be free of the
Inner turmoil that keeps us from
Loving one another.
And this will go on forever.

Let me take you to the point where I
Almost fell apart because I thought
EveryoneÂ’s the same and I donÂ’t fit.
But it turns out that were all from One.

EveryoneÂ’s going to be free of the
Inner turmoil that keeps us from
Loving one another.
And this will go on forever.

EverythingÂ’s so perfect,
So why do you always turn away,
When I look your way.

I never cried for you.
I donÂ’t think you did for me.
I never cried for you.
I donÂ’t think you did for me.

And you thought that I would never come back.
And maybe you are right,
But donÂ’t ever forget me.

DonÂ’t ever forget me.
