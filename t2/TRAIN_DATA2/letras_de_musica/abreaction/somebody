I want somebody to share,
Share the rest of my life,
Share my innermost thoughts
Know my intimate details.
Someone whoÂ’ll stand by my side
And give me support
And in return
SheÂ’ll get my support.
She will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
SheÂ’ll hear me out
And wonÂ’t easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact sheÂ’ll often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me.

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought
And with every breath
Someone whoÂ’ll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I donÂ’t want to be tied
To anyoneÂ’s strings
IÂ’m carefully trying to steer clear
Of those things
But when IÂ’m asleep
I want somebody
WhoÂ’ll put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
IÂ’ll get away with it
