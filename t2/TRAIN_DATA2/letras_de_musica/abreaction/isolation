I take advantage of my fun,
It will someday disappear.
The light is all I need to live,
It tells where IÂ’m going to fall.
Emptiness around the store,
Catch the drift or die in the mold.
Candle wax sticks to my soul,
It sticks forever and dries when itÂ’s cold.

Never leave,
Memories soon fade away.
Fade away.

I dream a dream,
ItÂ’s not what it seems.
Run away with me,
Face reality.
I wonÂ’t do that,
ItÂ’s not in my blood.
Everlasting smile,
In the dirty cell
Overcast a voice
To fit with the crowd

It canÂ’t be too good if you donÂ’t care,
Next time I wonÂ’t leave you there.
Never leave,
Memories soon fade away
Fade away.

IÂ’ve often tried to hold my need,
And I donÂ’t know why.
Deep down in my soul,
Eternal emptiness told a lie.

I donÂ’t care what you think of me,
Steal the lock and you still canÂ’t get in.
Be so simple, IÂ’m complex.
I try to live but I want to die.
Never feel the holes on your skin.
I will fill them with my love.
Never doubt, never leave
IÂ’ll be the one you want to be.

Take my book, donÂ’t give it back
I need it back so I could learn.
Feel the rage built in these rooms.
It never will return to peace.

IÂ’ve often tried to hold my need,
And I donÂ’t know why.
Deep down in my soul,
Eternal emptiness told a lie.

I take advantage of my fun,
It will someday disappear.
The light is all I need to live,
It tells where IÂ’m going to fall.

Never leave,
Memories soon fade away.
Fade away.

Never doubt the darkest day,
It will lead me out of here.
I was told to trust,
I stare at the fold, thereÂ’s no way to adjust.

Never doubt the darkest day,
It will lead me out of here
