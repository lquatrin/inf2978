I can see why you would be
The path I never chose to take.
You sit there with no worries on your mind.
And I stand here full of grief.
And it seems that I loved you all night long.
That other guy wonÂ’t remember a thing.
But I hold it all inside.

And I see you in the night,
And I feel you in my life.

Give me a clue cause I want a chance,
To find you out before he does.
Am I really lost forever?

And I see you in the night,
And I feel you in my life.

Do you really enjoy my pain?
Can you feel it?
IÂ’ve known you too long and I want you back
Back in my arms

And I see you in the night,
And I feel you in my life.

In the night
In the night
