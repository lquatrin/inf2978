Hidden dreams block my reality
Good will is never lost.
I feel stripped of disease
When you call my name
No profit is made when a person
Gains the world yet loses his soul
If you make me shed my tears
Then you should feel just as cold

I want to be the one who cures
I want to feel
I want to shed a ray of light
I want to hope

I live
I live

Our past is clean forgot
Our future is fate
We must preserve the past for the future
Even though our present cries
A picture is all you need
To hide all the scars
A fake smile is what it takes
To lure a person into trust

I want to be the one who cures
I want to feel
I want to shed a ray of light
I want to hope

I live
I live
