I try hard
To put you out of mind
Every night alone
I'm thinking 'bout you
Now can I avoid this
Pain without you
I won't cry
Won't be sorry no more
I know that this is
Something I'll get over
Maybe I can learn to love another
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
Just because I lock
Myself in my room
It doesn't mean that
I'm afraid to talk to
Those people I know
That might have you seen you
No return
I keep reminding myself
I look back
Don't regret a single moment
I gonna mend this heart
Inside you've broken
