Now the truth is clear, 
Now I wonder. 
People stay the same, 
And feelings never change. 
Now I talk to you, 
In ways I never used to. 
It really hurts to be 
In the healing process 

I never wanted to break it off completely 
I donÂ’t know what I said, but I never meant it. 

Why canÂ’t we be like we were two years ago. 
I realize that I am wrong, but now itÂ’s too late.

Certain things I do,
That remind me of you. 
Should I be happy, 
Or should I forget 
Everything we did 
Because itÂ’s all in the past? 
It really hurts to say 
That I still love you 

I never wanted to break it off completely 
I donÂ’t know what I said, but I never meant it.

Why canÂ’t we be like we were two years ago?
I realize that I am wrong, but now itÂ’s too late. 

Suddenly I feel, that none of this is real. 
Should I find another, so these thoughts escape? 

I never wanted to break it off completely 
I donÂ’t know what I said, but I never meant it.

Why canÂ’t we be like we were two years ago?
I realize that I am wrong, but now itÂ’s too late.

Now that we are through, itÂ’s hard to look at you.
Tell me what to do, to make this untrue
