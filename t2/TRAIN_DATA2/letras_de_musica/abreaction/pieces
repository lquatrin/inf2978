Give me time, and I will try
To prove that I wonÂ’t die
My thoughts go away,
When IÂ’m gone, not with you.

IÂ’m now clean to go outside.
Is that okay?
Oh please,
Get away from me.

HoldinÂ’ back on my ground.
Obsesses with you for way too long.
A smile would keep me alive.
But now itÂ’s way too late.

IÂ’m now clean to go outside.
Is that okay?
Oh please,
Get away from me.

My love is down the drain
For you I feel nothing.
DonÂ’t call me up at night.
You never did once before.
I swear, pieces are gone away

No sorrys for all the pain,
No guilt for leading me on.
I want you out of here.
That one night is lost in time
I swear, pieces are gone
For you, IÂ’ll still do
Anything in my heart
