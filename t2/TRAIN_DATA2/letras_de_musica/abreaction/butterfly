After all these cloudy days,
The sun finally came.
And a new beginning,
Everything is full of life.

I wanted everything,
Now itÂ’s the simple things I need.
To hear that sweet whisper,
Which made me always want toÂ….

Now I realize itÂ’s true,
That everything is in full bloom.
You are my butterfly,
DonÂ’t fly away.

Now I realize itÂ’s true,
That everything is in full bloom.
You are my butterfly,
DonÂ’t fly away. 
DonÂ’t fly away
