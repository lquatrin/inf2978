I still have pictures
Of when you would just stand by me
There are no excuses
For why I always wasnÂ’t there
You were my brother
Sometimes you were my only friend
I canÂ’t believe youÂ’ve gone away
But the memories remain

I still keep my door open
For maybe one last time
No one else would understand
Everything you are

I always felt it
But not as much until you left
There are no excuses
For why I always wasnÂ’t there

And now the year has passed
I never felt so cold
With your traces gone
I guess IÂ’ll have to go my own way alone

I hope you hear this
ItÂ’s the only way I could reach you

And all the things we did arenÂ’t gone
You inspired me all along
I hope you are happy where you are
And you gave me courage after all
