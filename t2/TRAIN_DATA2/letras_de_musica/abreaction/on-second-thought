I still can smell you on my clothes
I taste you on my lips like candy
why haven't I confronted you about this
like fairytales, the handsome prince will get you

I want you here next to me
so we could talk
on second thought I might be wrong
to even want

I see you in my dreams its so real
I hear you call my name when you're gone
why haven't I confronted you about this
like fairytales, the handsome prince will get you

I want you here next to me
so we could talk
on second thought I might be wrong
to even want

I feel that you're impossible to catch
but if I just stand here I will never know
when I see you
I will tell you
that you belong in my arms

I want you here next to me
so we could talk
on second thought I might be wrong to even want

on second thought I might be wrong
