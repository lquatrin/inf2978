Boring your so boring
lying on the bed, clothes left on the floor [the way you look at me]
you want more
reminders on the wall, of how it was last fall [what you said to me]
thats all gone
days seem longer, nights are worthless
together, satisfied, whenever we live this lie
complications break the ending to our story [the way you look at me]
final chapter
recycling my love, then throw it all away [what you said to me]
end again
days seem longer, nights are worthless
captions on the page say what we can't say [i remember]
boring your so boring
lying on the bed, clothes left on the floor [the way you look at me]
you want more
reminders on the wall of how it was last fall [the things you said to me]
that all gone
days seem longer, nights are worthless
captions on the page say what we can't say [i remember]
...i don't need you anymore
