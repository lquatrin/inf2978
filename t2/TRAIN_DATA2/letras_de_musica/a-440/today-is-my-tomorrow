run..
This all started late one night
awake in bed she held me tight
i can't forgive, i can't forget
the problems i just won't admit
and all these things they cloud my head
like L.A. skylines in the West
although i understand concern
let's let this build up
think i'll wait, think i'll wait, one more day
think i'll wait for tomorrow, wait for tomorrow
i find it hard enough to breathe
without you there at my feet
say goodbye to all my problems
with a final kiss
i think i'll wait, think i'll wait, one more day
think i'll wait for tomorrow, wait for tomorrow
[think of the times i've learned,
think of the times i've burned]
outside i stand alone,
words and phrases i should have known
starring in your eyes, my God i finally realize
i'll wait, think i'll wait, one more day
think i'll wait for tomorrow, wait tomorrow
i'll wait, think i'll wait, one more day
think i'll wait for tomorrow, wait for tomorrow
