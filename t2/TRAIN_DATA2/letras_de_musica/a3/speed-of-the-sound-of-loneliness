Come home late, come home early
Come home big when I'm feelin' small
Come home straight, come home fucked-up
Sometimes I don't come home at all

CHORUS

What in the world has come over me?
What in heavenÂ’s name have I done?
I've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
I'm out there running just to be on the run


You've a heart that burns with a fever
You've got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Leave me so damn far behind?

Tell me now

CHORUS


It's a mighty mean and dreadful sorrow
[Heartbreakin's what it is]
It's crossed that evil line today
[Let's cross it together, hand-in-hand]
I can't think about tomorrow
[Well now, who can?]
I ain't got one word to say
[Now sing along]

CHORUS
