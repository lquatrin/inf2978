You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Your mama always said you'd be
The chosen one.

She said: you're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.

When you woke up this morning
All that love had gone,
Your papa never told you
About right and wrong.

But you're, but you're looking good, baby,
I believe that you're feeling fine, (shame about it),
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes.

Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning

You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down,
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same
Since the blues walked in our town.

Baby, but you're, but you're one in a million
You've got that shotgun shine; shame about it,
Born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning

When you woke up this morning everything was gone.
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong.
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
Like a voice telling you there was something you should know.
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that you wonder if you'll ever know
The meaning of things as they appear to the others:
Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers.
Don't you wish you didn't function,
Don't you wish you didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink'
Well you do so make up your mind to go on,'cos
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You wanna be the chosen one.

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
