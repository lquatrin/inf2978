Till death do us part.
YouÂ’re still safe, crossed my hart
She shook here head and gave me a blow for breakfast
Till death do us part
God I know we donÂ’t belong here,
Is that a quote that sounds familiar to you these days?

For crying out loud
Stop messing with the peopleÂ’s head
Stop messing
Â‘Cause the joke ainÂ’t funny
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all

Till death do us part
You looked at me, we connected
She took my hand and started running all the way.
Till death kicks in your face
Three boys dead, non that I knew from
It took us down for a few showers in the afternoon.

For crying out loud
Stop messing with the peopleÂ’s head
Stop messing
Â‘Cause the joke ainÂ’t funny
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all

Me and my girl in a love machine, your Toyota is fantastic
It takes us down away from here, your Toyota is fantastic
I know a house upon a hill; we could stay there if you will
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic
Me and my girl on a trip
Me and my girl on a trip to heaven, your Toyota is fantastic.

For crying out loud
Stop messing with the peopleÂ’s head
Stop messing
Â‘Cause the joke ainÂ’t funny
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
The joke ainÂ’t canny at all
