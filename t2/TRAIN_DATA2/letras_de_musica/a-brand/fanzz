Olalala Chiquita Señorita

SheÂ’s a woman and IÂ’m a man
She got dreams and I got plans
But donÂ’t you worry
IÂ’ll be nice
But I donÂ’t need your good advice

So tell me baby what is it
Â‘Cause I donÂ’t need this fucking shit
If you love me, love me wise
Â‘Cause I donÂ’t need your good advice

Everybody clap your hands, everybody just be fanzz
Everybody shut your mouth
I gotta move on, I gotta be strong

Playing drums is kind of easy
Rock Â’n roll is very sleazy
So mister teacher you are so wise
But I donÂ’t need your good advice

Yes I can play and I can play
And I will show you mister my way
Shit that was nice
But I donÂ’t need your good advice

Everybody clap your hands, everybody just be fanzz
Everybody shut your mouth
I gotta move on, I gotta be strong

Do you know the generation thing?
About the one whoÂ’s old and slim?
Hey baby boy IÂ’ve seen the war
YouÂ’ve seen the war but I know more
So tell me sucker, you medium fucker
Your critics smell like jealousy
You need more gain and less sustain
So they forgot to give your brain

Everybody clap your hands, everybody just be fanzz
Everybody shut your mouth
I gotta move on, I gotta be strong
