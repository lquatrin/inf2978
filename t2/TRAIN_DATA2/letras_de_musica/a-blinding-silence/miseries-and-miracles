and I donÂ’t believe in miracles.
a light can only shine for so long
then it fades away
and IÂ’m failing inside
and the shadows my eyes
find are blinding and breaking me.

and I donÂ’t believe in miracles
a love can only fight for so long
then it fades away.
even love must expire
and the hurt kills my eyes
it is blinding and breaking me

and I never stop to smell the rose.
the thorns can only sting for so long
then it fades away 
even hurt has to die
just the blink of an eye
and I know nothing gold can stay

and I never stop to smell the rose
an ache by any other name
would still kill me the same
i am darkening inside
and this absence of light
it is blinding and breaking me

and IÂ’m fearing that weÂ’re on our own
a heart can fight for so long then it tears away
leaving absence of doubt and a soul crying out 
that there must be a better way 

and IÂ’m looking for a miracle
a life can only fail for so long then it must be saved
a light shining so bright intervening divine 
be it blinding
