your lacerating lips lain upon mine for the last time
painful papercuts strewn across my gums
your such a pretty example of a picture perfect portrait painted with my blood from each time i kissed your photo goodbye...
...goodbye lover, im dripping myself dry, no more tears i'll xxxxxxx cry, i will bleed no more, there'll be no more scars across my arm, all i have to do is tear every letter and burn all the envelopes and watch the embers float away...
...i xxxxxxx hate what i became, a hollow shell shot straight to hell, empty eyes and an empty casket, you wont kill me that easy...
...staring down a lovers corpse
ive never felt so alive, its a pity you couldnt survive to see the smile on my face...
...your lips will lacerate mine for the last time, painful papercuts still stewn across my gums, such a pretty example of a picture pefect portrait painted with my blood from each time i kissed your photo goodbye...
...im not as crazy as i seem, i hope you know this is all a dream, just a fucked up dream...
...please tell me this was a dream...
