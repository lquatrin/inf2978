Freddy wants to be a cartoon superhero and he never goes outside
His eyes are glued to the TV screen most every day and night
S'not making friends at school, his parents have concerns
But he always tunes in and tunes them out wishing one day he would get his turn
Freddy never ever studies and he's proud of his straight C's
And chain smoking in the parking lot pretending to be James Dean
Kids call him a freak and a weirdo and he won't won't amount to anything
While psychologists get paid to analyze his anti-social tendencies
Late one Saturday night drinking beer and getting high
He got struck by lightening twice and decided to leave that life behind
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause 
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back
Now Freddy is a young shorthaired suit-wearing corporate middle manager
Making $90,000 a year he keeps his wife knee-deep in pearls
Seems he pulled it together and should be sitting pretty for life
But staring out his hi-rise corner office window, he's not feeling that satisfied
Then one Saturday night working late he started to sigh
Where did the all the good times go, where's that kid I used to know..
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause 
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back
Quit the job, leave the wife, and get a few tattoes
Play guitar every night and start singing the blues
He always told me that one day he'd be king of the world
And the weak and the meek shall inherit the earth
Better check yourself and watch your step cause 
He's the comeback kid...he's coming back, he's making a comeback
