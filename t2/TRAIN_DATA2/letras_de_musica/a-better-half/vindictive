Well I just wanted to say thanks for leading me on
And thanks for giving me the inspiration for this song
I can't believe I wasted precious time on a bitch like you
I hope you're happy about all the shit you made me suffer through
Call me bitter and I'll just admit it
I'm holding a grudge and I won't quit it
Cause I'm one vindictive son of a bitch
And one of these days you'll get yours, Ain't life rich

You said you'd call me and you promised that we'd hang out the next day
So I waited by the phone without luck much to my dismay
Apparently by "we" you meant yourself and two other guys
So first you humored me and then you filled my head with lies

Call me bitter and I'll just admit it
I'm holding a grudge and I won't quit it
Cause I'm one vindictive son of a bitch
And one of these days you'll get yours, Ain't life rich

Well I just wanted to say thanks for leading me on
And thanks for giving me the inspiration for this song
I can't believe I wasted precious time on a bitch like you
I hope you're happy about all the shit you made me suffer through

Call me bitter and I'll just admit it
I'm holding a grudge and I won't quit it
Cause I'm one vindictive son of a bitch
And one of these days you'll get yours, Ain't life rich
