In my dreams it worked out every time
I had it planned out to the last line
We'd talk together all night
I would hold her in my arms
Wouldn't leave each others sight
She would be my lucky charm

Imagination, I think it's working overtime
Infatuation, I wish that she would be mine
Built last night up in my head
It was something that she said
I thought we'd be together
But she ditched me instead

Things were going according to my plans
But at the last minute she up and ran
She said that she was tired
This left me out on my own
She is a fucking liar
I'm used to being alone

Imagination, I think it's working overtime
Infatuation, I wish that she would be mine
Built last night up in my head
It was something that she said
I thought we'd be together
But she ditched me instead

In my mind nothing ever went wrong
I was left behind by reality for so long
This girl made me think I was someone special to her
I've been carrying these false hopes, I'm such a loser

Imagination, I think it's working overtime
Infatuation, I wish that she would be mine
Built last night up in my head
It was something that she said
I thought we'd be together
But she ditched me instead
