I've got no one to impress but a whole world to ignore
And I'm just like all the rest: always down and wanting more
Blind believer, under achiever
My friends all say that I should leave her
Safe within my dreams, tell me why it seems
That every girl is out of my league

Too much of a good thing: a thought too good to be true
Tired of this lonely feeling, there's not a thing I can do
In denial, faking smiles
It's true I never fit the profile
Of the perfect guy, I'll never know why
It seems every girl is out of my league

Did I set my standards too high?
Did I set any at all?
All my dreams are up in the sky
You can watch them as they fall

Blind believer, under achiever
My friends all say that I should leave her
Safe within my dreams, tell me why it seems
That every girl is out of my league
