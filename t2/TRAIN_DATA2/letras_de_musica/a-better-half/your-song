I sit alone and think about you,
But there's nothing I can do.
I'm feeling lonely all by myself
Knowing you're with someone else
And I can't stop thinking about you.

I cant stop thinking about you
When you're not around
All the pain I have been through
When you're nowhere to be found
I can't help but remember
All the smiles that we have shared

I pace back and forth in my room
Hoping that I'll see you soon
This restlessness inside of me
Isn't helping anything
'Cause I cant stop thinking about you.

I cant stop thinking about you
When you're not around.
All the pain I have been through
When you're nowhere to be found.
I can't help but remember
All the smiles that we have shared.

And all the things you'd say
Make it so hard to walk away.
And I'm losing my
Yeah I'm losing my mind

I wait up all night by the phone
Waiting for you to come home.
I never thought that it would be
A girl in control of me,
And I can't stop thinking about you.

I cant stop thinking about you
When you're not around.
All the pain I have been through
When you're nowhere to be found.
I can't help but remember
All the smiles that we have shared.
