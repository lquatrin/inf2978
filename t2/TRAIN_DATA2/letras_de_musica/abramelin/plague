Driven by an unknown force, awakened from eternal sleep 
Dried up eyes snap open wide as hunger starts to creep 
Deflated hearts begin to pump, sunken chests begin to rise 
Crypts and tombs around the globe spit forth sepulchral cries 
Rotten hands break though the earth, 
morgue draws start to open 
Funeral parlours liven up as coffin-lids a broken 
Hysteria begins to mount as people flee and try to hide 
As shambling armies of the dead begin to end mankind 

The uttermost catastrophe, surpassing your worst dreams 
Chewing at the insides of vomit-coated cheeks, to prevent your final screams 
A hoard of decayed twisted filth, a horrid mass of wormy flesh 
The air fills with the stench of rot, diseased and fetid putrid death 
A thirst for blood the taste of flesh, their only thought the need to eat 
To fondle innards warm and soft, embedding teeth in blood-soaked meat 

Chorus 
Lips pulled back in a rictus grin 
Bones protrude through decayed skin 
Rotten lungs breathe nauseous breath 
Through twisted fangs in jaws of death 

A vile and nauseous rancid stench chokes the once pure air 
Decayed left over dinner scraps, discarded everywhere 
An arm, a leg, a severed head - body parts and ravaged meat 
Clotted stains lay on the ground of silent city streets
