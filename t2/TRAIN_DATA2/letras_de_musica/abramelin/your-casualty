Let me be your casualty 
I loathe this world so set me free 
This is not the place I want to be 
Let me be your casualty 
Your unbalanced brain can have it's way 
To do all the horrid things I say 
I need to perish. Can't you see? 
Let me be your casualty 

Pound my flesh till it's sickening blue 
Ignore my screams and do what you do 
I cower and whimper from your lethal assault 
My wounds stand wide open. Where is the salt? 
Fucked in the arse till I bleed blue guts 
Scalding my eyes with cigarette butts 
My genitals bleeding you moan with desire 
Plugging my ears with coat-hanger wire 

Sickened with madness, wielding your blade 
Fucking the holes that your weapon has made 
Blood boils forth from my panicked remains 
Removing my scalp, extracting my brain 

Berserking with your cleaver you beat me to the ground 
Slabs of meat discarded, bloodshed all around 
My body reduced to a puddle of red 
You finger my larynx where once sat my head 
Where is my saviour? Where is the light? 
I'm drowning in darkness surrounded by night 
Left all alone and filled with despair 
Because of the life that I just could not bare
