Consigned to the tomb, to sleep, to dream forever.
Rotting... dissolving in my grave clothes, my
Flesh turns to soup.
A distant thud, as a shovel parts the earth.
By moon lit night, a looming shadow... sunken
Eyes, gaze up to the stars.
My shrouded, decomposing corpse,
Sprawled on frozen marble.
Carefully unwrapping,
Your putrid, fly-blown prize.
Disrobed you sit upon me,
Straddling my death remains.
Momentum slowly building makes a horrid
Slushing sound.

Chorus
Stench rising, blood thirsting
Flesh peeling, sores bursting

Repeat

Gripping tight to my exposed ribs,
Your cumming in a frenzy.
Draining every bit of love my body has to offer.
Kissing teeth where lips once sat,
A foul and bitter taste.
Lapping at my putrid flesh,
You puke into my sockets.

Chorus
Stench rising, blood thirsting
Flesh peeling, sores bursting

Your task is complete. my corpse lies in a heap.
Spewing forth my rotten dregs... dribbling,
Oozing down your legs.
