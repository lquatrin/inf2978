I'm in love with death- I Live for it. I die for it 
Your life! Is mine to take away. 
I'm here for the kill- I smell it. I taste it 
I'll masturbate! All over your shallow grave. 
The night is when I'll strike 
- darkness is my domain. 
A fever of lust burns through my loins 
at the sight of you in pain. 
I adore the screaming whore. 
Begging for her life. 
Her hot blood streams upon my face. 
She's now my dying bride. 

Chorus
Ripped from cunt to chest, 
Your flesh burns as I hack 
My cock grows hard as I kill. 
I'm the nekromaniak 

You're out of luck, you bitching fuck, you'll cry 
with one last gasp 
I smell your fear, your end is here- here at last! 
Now don't you fret. I've not come yet 
- you are my darling slut! 
I'll pull you down, into the ground 
and give you one last fuck! 
Your body still warm yet lifeless, 
Your death is such a sight. 
I pump your corpse in ecstasy then cum at 
death's delight. 

Chorus
