Pevajuci svoju elegiju
Jadikovanje mracnim carstvima
Jednom padose nikad vise
Vaskrsli hor drevnog kraljevstva

From the dark past, thy renewal
Has brought thou to thy ancient throne
Embalmed in dust of years before
A thousand year curse has been sealed
Singing their funeral dirge
Lament for dark royalties
Once failed and never again
Followed by choir of an ancient kingdom
Now rise, forever

Thou shall rise followed by ice wind and nothern lightnings
Triarchy of souls, which will never find rest gathered in sin

Iz davne proslosti
Na presto donosi
Usnula povorka
Hor drevnog kraljevstva
(vecno pevaju kroz noc)

Greeting thee to stand above them
To rule again, to plant thy seals
