Looking back, into a memory, keeps me further away from my destiny.
I lost track of time, now I've lost my life.
Time can try to control me but the present has nothing to show me.
I swear to god there is nothing left except the past.
Time's heart is beating slowly and fading fast, goodbye to every memory.
Goodbye to then and now, and the unseen.
Looking back, into a memory, keeps me further away from my destiny, my destiny.
Visions, visions of a time long lost.
Visions, visions of what I have lost.
How do you say goodbye to something that is not real?
It's so hard to say goodbye to something you can't feel.
Can we cherish this moment?
