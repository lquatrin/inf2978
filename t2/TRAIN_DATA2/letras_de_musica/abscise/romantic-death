It never ends, in dreams we breed decisions, freed from false convictions.
Superficial flattery ends with sexual calamity. Lay beside me and we'll suffer together.
Never, our pupils coiled, black to black. Place your elegant wounds upon my back.
My heart will never forgive me if I don't see you again.
There's no hope for our hearts to stay together, so why try to go on? So why try? Forever.
You struck the match, you set me ablaze.
My eyes roll to the back of my head where my hopes are lost and my dreams are dead.
My eyes roll (I'm dead inside of you).
I want you dead.
How can love be the success of life, when it only leaves you dead?
How can love be the success of life, when it only leaves you wanting to die?
How can love be the success of life, when it only leaves us wanting to die? Dead.
Our pupils coiled black to black, place your elegant wounds upon my back.
Romantic death.
My eyes roll to the back of my head where my hopes are lost and my dreams are dead.
Is this for you? Is this for us?
