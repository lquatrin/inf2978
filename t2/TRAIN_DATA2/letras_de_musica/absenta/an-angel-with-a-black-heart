Saw it in her, something hide in deepest entrails.
Felt itin her words, thes make me feel like I float over a cloud.
She invited me, to save me of my poor live.
With her lips, she submerged me into the longest night.

I am in ecstasy, because of your breathless, I decided to offer my soul, and shone your eyes, and showed your heart, and I don,t see love.
What stupid and visceral I have been, now I am capture in your exorcism of with.


When the night begin exiting you,
With the moonlight, your behaivour is extrange,
Your face turn pale and your eyes burn,
Now you have my soul and want fuck me.

Saw it in her, something hide in deepest entrails.
Felt itin her words, thes make me feel like I float over a cloud.

I,m exploting to pleasure when you dance for me,
waiting that this enjoyment give felicity.
Why i need you so? You are like my drug,
I,m so adict to you I will kill for you.
Still I can,t distinguish between the true love
or the evil exorcism is the reason of my chaining.
I try, really I try to leave your company,
I know you corner me and after there won,t be exit.
Yesterday I decided to escape from your claws,
and I feel something extrange, I don,t like.
Now I,m lost on darkness of lonelyness,
needing taste again the pleasure of your flesh.
Another time the sky is cover and grey,
the silence is break because of the rain.
Therfore if my soul have topay of your heart,
it,ll be yours.
