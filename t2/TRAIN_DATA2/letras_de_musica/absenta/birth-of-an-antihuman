That night over the montain range,
One light revealed a humble house.
They were waiting for the last son,
She started to give born
But no skin just fur on that face
And that creature came out entire.
Blood but no human cover the whole floor,
Cod! screamed the old woman, why to me if iÂ’m noone?
All i need is to kill every man on the earth,
All i need is to kill the fucking assholes arround me.
No more chances for your species,
No more rise, now breeding.
All i need is to kill every man on the earth,
All i need is to kill the fucking assholes arround me.
IÂ’m the chosen messenger
Who will lead the reast of wild boars
Through this range where man is still weak,
And we will seek every human been.
Night is our aliade to recover our lands.
Oak give us shelter, become it in a fortress.
I have come for all your fails,
Now is the time to repair it.
You will pay for come inside,
In our kingdom of rage
