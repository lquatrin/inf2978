Dark clouds threaten from south,
Their black tops start to grow,
The men run to shelter
Â‘cause rain beat their advantage.
Huge sheet climbing the range
Cover it on wet silence,
The men still keep quite
Whereas troops advance no be seen.
Lightning burn every house!
Thunders deafen their ears!
Flashes lead our legions!
White fog blind human sight!
Small drops join on the ground!
Create a flood which submerge their goods!
Greatures take your booty!
Summit order to dispersion!
Lightning burn every house!
Thunders deafen their ears!
Flashes lead our legions!
White fog blind human sight!
Small drops join on the ground!
Create a flood which submerges their goods!
Greatures take your booty!
Summit order to dispersion!
Take the external clay layer and become in a fatal death,
Fill the houses with your brown disease untill bery
Everything,
Throw the invaders out from your floodpliain and
Recover what is yours.
