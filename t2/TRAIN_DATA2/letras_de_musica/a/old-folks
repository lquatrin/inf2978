I don't know I'm born, I'm only young 
I don't have a choice, you know I'm only young 
I'm getting older, I'm getting smaller 
Everybody tells you, "you've got to walk taller" 
You did a war, and now you're poor 
And like your friends, you're gonna get it in the end 

You've heard it all before 
You can't go on much more 
It's not like I think 
The old folks are losers 
They can't work computers 
They die in December time 

Can't put it off, you put it on 
Don't ever stop, it doesn't last long 
The younger folk, they 
Don't understand, they 
Back in the day, they 
You're gonna get it in the end 

You heard it all before 
You can't go on much more 
Its not like I think 
The old folks are losers 
They can't work computers 
They die in December time 

Fall down for no reason 
The churches are heaving 
The old folks, they live the life 

I'm down on the floor, I'll settle down, do what I tell ya. 
You're gonna get it in the end, 
You're gonna get it in the end 

The old folks are losers, they can't work computers 
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers 

The old folks are losers 
They can't work computers 
They die in December time 

Fall down for no reason 
The churches are heaving 
The old folks remember why 

The old folks are losers 
They can't work computers 
They die in December time
