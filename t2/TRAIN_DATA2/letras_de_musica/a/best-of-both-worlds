I don't know what I've been livin' on, but
It's not enough to fill me up
I need more than just words can say
I need everything this life can give me. Hey-hey yeah
'Cause sometimes it's not enough. Ow!
Come on baby, close your eyes, let go
This can be everything we dreamed
It's not work that makes it work, oh
No, let the magic do the work for you

'Cause honey, something reached out and touched me
Now I know all I want


I want the best of both worlds
An' honey I know what it's worth
If we could have the best of both worlds
We'd have heaven right here on earth. Woo!

Well, there's a picture in a gallery of
A fallen angel looked a lot like you
We forget where we come from sometimes
I had a dream it was really you

Something reached out and touched me
Now I know all I want






Whoa, you don't have to die an' go to heaven
Or hang around to be born again
Just tune in to what this place has got to offer
'Cause we may never be here again. Ow!



I want the best of both worlds
An' honey I know what it's worth
If we could have the best of both worlds
A little heaven right here on earth. Come on!

I want the best of both worlds
An' honey I know what it's worth
We can have the best of both worlds
A little heaven right here on earth, yeah

Tell me, is it enough? Wow!
Now will it ever be enough? Wow-oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh
