There's a fire in my heart 
And it's burning all the time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
How you ever sleep at night 
I've been calling in the dark 
I've been counting on your time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
Why it hurts to be alive 

Got a message on my phone 
I wasn't keeping count 
I know you like to talk in code 
I've got you figured out 
Nobody said it was easy 
Yeah, but you gotta believe me 
Because I'm losing out 
Yeah, I gotta tell ya 

There's a fire in my heart 
And it's burning all the time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
How you ever sleep at night 
I've been calling in the dark 
I've been counting on your time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
Why it hurts to be alive 

What is the chance of making life? 
Pick up the panic stations 
And I can only sympathize 
With your hesitations 
You can dance the night away 
You can force yourself to stay 
When you're easing on the brakes 
And taking care of things 

There's a fire in my heart 
And it's burning all the time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
How you ever sleep at night 
I've been calling in the dark 
I've been counting on your time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
Why it hurts to be alive 

No one sends letters anymore 
That's what we've got computers for 
Cleaning the shit up from the floor 
That's what I live for 
That's what I live for 

Let me down and leave me hopeless 
Stay around and talk it over 
Let me down and leave me hopeless 
Stay around and talk it over 

There's a fire in my heart 
And it's burning all the time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
How you ever sleep at night 
I've been calling in the dark 
I've been counting on your time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
Why it hurts to be alive 

There's a fire in my heart 
And it's burning all the time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
How you ever sleep at night 
I've been calling in the dark 
I've been counting on your time 
And I wonder, and I wonder 
Why it hurts to be alive 

Let me down and leave me hopeless 
Stay around and talk it over 
Let me down and leave me hopeless 
Stay around and talk it over
