Wise men say only fools rush in
But i can't help falling in love with you
Shall i say would it be a sin
(be a sin)
If i can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows (oooh)
To the sea (oooh)
So it goes
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand (take my hand)
Take my whole life too (life too)
For i can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say only fools rush in
But i, i can't, i can't help falling in love (falling in love) with you (with you)

Like a river flows (oooh)
To the sea (oooh)
So it goes
Some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

[chorus x2]

Like a river flows
That's the way it goes
I just can't help fallin' in love with you
(fallin' in love with you)
Like a river flows (yea yea)
That's the way it goes(cause i can't)
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows (i just can't help myself)
That's the way it goes
I can't help falling in love with you
(i can't help falling in love with you) [x2]

Fallin'in love with you
