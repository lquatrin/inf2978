Trying to think, ? 
Save it for another day 
nna send me to an early grave 
Some might say, yeah ? 
I don't mind, better time 
Looking forward 15 years to go 

Never gonna do what i'm told 
Even when I'm 40 years old 
Gunna have a pool full of rides 
Always keep my eye on the time 
When i'm 40 
I'll still be 20 
And that's a promise 
I feel alzheimerÂ’s 

Don't just shout, sort it out 
Give me time, get off me first 
?, early mornings 
Go to work at dawn 
Who needs more?, you can talk 
All i ever do is talk 
I don't mind, better time 
Looking forward 15 years to go 

Never gunna do what i'm told 
Even when i'm 40 years old 
Gunna have a pool full of rides 
Always keep my eye on the time 
When 'm 40 
I'll still be 20 
And that's a promise 
I feel alzheimerÂ’s
