I'm over it, I'm not doing it for you 
Fully over it, I'm just doing it for me 

Don't do what you're thinking, 
Don't do what you like 
Don't know if I figured 
Though you never know, I might 

Before we go to bed 

I'm over it, I'm not doing it for you 
Fully over it, I'm just doing it for me 

Call me what you want 
You call me minor threat 
I didn't spend a week on it, 
You're given what you get 

Tell us in the basement 
Before you kick it off 

Look at your face, you're all over the place 
And you don't look happenin' to me 
Stuck in your scene and your rock magazine 
And your rules on how it should be 

Takin' a stand, make you look at my band 
And you're giving the finger to me 
I'll go where I want to and I'll show what I want to 
And I float in circles like this- 

I'm over it, I'm not doing it for you 
Fully over it, I'm just doing it for me
