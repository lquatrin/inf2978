Every day is like a Monday morning 
Every day is always grey and boring 
Get out of bed, out of your head 
Like anyone, like anyone 

You second guess what is in the papers 
You do your best to annoy the neighbours 
I need a holiday, You're underpaid 
Like anyone, like anyone 

You're smashing up the bus stops (bus stop) 
There's panic when the snow drops (snow drop) 
You blow a ton, to have some fun 
Like anyone, like anyone 

Welcome to my land, this broken island 
Not all it's cracked up to be 
And we're second best to all the rest 
So count me out 'cause I confess 
I'm over it and it is over me 

Every day it's just repeats on TV 
But that's ok 'cause you never pay your fee 
And now we're late, learn to hate 
Like everyone, like everyone 

Forever losing at our own game (own game) 
But we invented it, so no shame (no shame) 
Another war will feed the poor 
Like anyone, like everyone 

Welcome to my land, this broken island 
Not all it's cracked up to be 
And we're second best to all the rest 
So count me out 'cause I confess 
I'm over it and it is over me 

Welcome to my land, this broken island 
Not all it's cracked up to be 
And we're second best to all the rest 
So count me out 'cause I confess 
I'm over it and it is over me 

Welcome to my land, this broken island 
Not all it's cracked up to be 
And we're second best to all the rest 
So count me out 'cause I confess 
I'm over it and it is over me, yeah!
