Oooo, First stepped out of the aeroplane
I Felt like I'd been here before
Took a calm look down, put a smile on my face
Felt like I could do more 

How ace are buildings?
How big are the blocks?
Were going around them
Stuck in a graveyard

Six foot deep, bleaker street, no-one in town
People smile, never got the time
I look down, I cannot see the ground
The man who reads the news says there's no crime

There's no-one around
There wasn't a sound
There's nowhere to rest
There gonna get

Fell in love with it, don't wanna leave it
Don't ever wanna go back
Skateboards are cheaper, everything's bigger
Whole place stops for the Winter of '96

Minus 10, 1pm, eats through his time
I laugh at your Denver sea bar
Snowstorm, so we walk 70 blocks
On days like this, nothing seems too far

Get in the shot
I don't ask a lot
The weather was frozen
It wasn't a great shock

Fell in love with it, don't wanna leave it
Don't ever wanna go back
Skateboards are cheaper, everything's bigger
Whole place stops for the Winter of '96

Maybe I could be here a long time
Much longer than I planned to stay
No telling when they'll get the airport open
No telling when I'll get away

Trying to tell that nothing's wrong
Trying to get the car back on
Never lost a day of fun
Silence in their heads, but thats not me

How ace are buildings?
How big are the blocks?
Reminds me of London,
Stuck in a gridlock
