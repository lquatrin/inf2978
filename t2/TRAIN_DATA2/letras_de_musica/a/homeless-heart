Lonesome Stranger,
With a crowd around you,
I see who you are,
You joke, they laugh,
Till the show is over,
Then you fall so hard,

If you're leading a soul to soul connection
IÂ’ll run to your side

When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
IÂ’ll be a home, to your homeless heart

Open, close me, leave your secrets with me
I can ease your pain
And my arms will be, just like walls around you
come in from the rain,
If your running, in the wrong direction,
I will lead you back

When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
IÂ’ll be a home, to your homeless heart

Broken, shattered like a mirror in a million pieces
Sooner or later
YouÂ’ve got to find
Something, Someone
To find you and save you

When you're lost in the dark
When you're out in the cold
When you're looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house of cards
IÂ’ll be a home, to your homeless heart

When your looking for something that resembles your soul
When the wind blows your house apart
IÂ’ll be a home, to your homeless heart
IÂ’ll be a home, to your homeless heart
