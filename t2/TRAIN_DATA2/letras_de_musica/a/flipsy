Come on..
Shalalalala.. Shalalalala

[Chorus]
Some day, we gonna rise up on that wind, you know,
Some day, We gonna dance, with those lions..
Someday, we gonna break free from these chains.. 
And keep on, flyin..
Yeaa..

They tellin me it's all good, just wait
You know im gonna be there, some day
Sippin on champain, ok, 
Gotta get these things, one day
You've been through another lie,

You know, 

Searchin for that other high,
Starve or i gotta steal, We steal
Kill or im gonna be killed,
I got a sack in my pocket..
Count ya gel and drop it,*
You know we gonna lose it..

Some day..

And we try to hold it all together, 
But the devil is too clever so
I'm gonna die, You gonna die, We gonna die,
Some day, one day, I said..

[Chorus]
Some day, we gonna rise up on that wind, you know,
Some day, We gonna dance, with those lions..
Someday, we gonna break free from these chains.. 
And keep on, flyin.. Yea. 

Come on..

Try ta lie, but it aint me
Aint me, tryin ta look but I cant see,
Cant stop right now, cause im too far
And I cant keep goin cause it's too hard
When the day and the night- is the same thing,
Only field on the block, It's the same game

Only real if you stop, Then thres no pain
But ya cant feel pain, and it's no game.
Rearrange and ya change and its all there,
Then ya try to maintain but ya fall back,
When ya crawl and ya slip and ya slide down,
Gonna make it to the top, and it's hard now,

Tore a hole in my soul and i die hard,
All alone in the night, in the graveyard
Some day, one day, Imma be free
And they wont try ta kill me for being me.

Hey,
Someday.

[Chorus]
Some day, we gonna rise up on that wind, you know,
Some day, We gonna dance, with those lions..
Someday, we gonna break free from these chains.. 
And keep on, flyin.. Yea. 



If you know how this is, 
Gonna see, It's not that easy.
Dont stop, get it till it's done,*
And where you are or I'll be gone,

I said..
Keep on, Try a little harder,
To see everything, you need to be..

Believe. In your dreams, that you see,
When your asleep....

[Chorus w. different end]
Some day, we gonna rise up on that wind, you know,
Some day, We gonna dance, with those lions..
Someday, we gonna break free from these chains.. 
And keep on, Keep on, Keep on, Keep on, 

Keep on flyin... Yea..

Get it right now..[x like 20] Till song fades.
