Five pretty boys for ten shitty years

Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears

I need a reaction, a new revolution

All over the country, but they took it away 



Took it away, it can't be impossible

Playing the records that they play in hospital

Radio playlist for terminally ill

You can't tell they're miming when you're over the hill 



And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)

It goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 



And if you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

Second-hand hits and a million misses

Nobody means it, they're making up stories

You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the 'Tories 



I blame myself, I want an easy life

Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 



It goes on (and on, and on, and on...)

It goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 



And if you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away 



They took it away, left us with nothing

You suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away, left us with nothing

You suffer the pain of your fingers burning



It goes on (and on, and on, and on...)

Took it away, left us with nothing

Suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away, left us with nothing

Suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away, left us with nothing

Suffer the pain of your fingers burning

Took it away, left us with nothing



And if you put it like that, you'll be dead some day

Set the record straight - they took it all away
