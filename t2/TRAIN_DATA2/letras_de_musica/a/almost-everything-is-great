You've killed it off 
I can't believe the things you're telling me 
I hope you're joking 
I can't take this seriously 

What a stupid question! 
What are you on about? 
Every time there's a loop hole you can't make me 
What a good reaction 
I don't know what to say 
You got (x7) 
me fooled 

Take it as a friend 
Yeah, like you want one 

It's time I smashed up my piggy bank 
It's no good 'cos it's made out of concrete 
Here I am making pounds to give away 
So what are your fivers in advance 

What a stupid question! 
I don't know the answer 
It's not fair 
Not oh yeah, yeah you'll make me 
I bet you can't stop laughing 
I bet your my last hope 
You got- (x7) me fooled 

Looking back 
Almost everything was great 

For a second you almost ruined everything 
For a while it was too good to be true 

Looking back 
Almost everything is great 
Take it all on board 
Almost everything is great 

Can you understand? (x6)
