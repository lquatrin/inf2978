There's nothing real about your fight 
Nothing in the shit you write 
You've got charisma in your hair 
The make up lady put it there, and it's 

(1+2+3+4) x (2+2+3+4) x (2x3) + (2+4) = 666 

One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? 
You bring it on, The Monkey Kong 
It's just a name, they got it wrong 

Every second, every day, every minute that you waste 
You're not every thing you seem 
Keep on fighting for the right 
Keep it rocking every night 
That's exactly what I mean 
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong 

You're the captain of the team 
You're the new king of the scene 
You hire a guy to keep you punk 
Laugh it up 'cause you don't know you're sunk 

(1+2+3+4) x (2+2+3+4) x (2x3) + (2+4) = 666 

And it's one, one plus two is three, can't we get along? 
You bring it on, The Monkey Kong 
It's just a name, they got it wrong 

Every second, every day, every minute that you waste 
You're not every thing you seem 
Keep on fighting for the right 
Keep it rocking every night 
That's exactly what I mean 
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey... 

1 + 2 = 4, wrong - try again 
1 + 2 = 2, that's incorrect 

How high can you try? (x8) 

Every second, every day, every minute that you waste 
You're not every thing you seem 
Keep on fighting for the right 
Keep it rocking every night 
That's exactly what I mean 
It don't matter what you say 
It won't change it anyway 
You're not what you want to be 
Every minute that you waste 
When you're taking on the place 
That's exactly what I mean 

Yeah, it's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong 
Monkey Kong, they called it Monkey Kong
