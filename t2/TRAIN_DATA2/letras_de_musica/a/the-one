She is the one next to me when I wake up in the morning 
She is the one who listens even though I know i'm boring 
When I'm awake when I'm away 
She is the one who knows whats going on before i say 
I am the one who ruins everything before its started 
And everyone's a nice guy you could trust them so good hearted 
It gets me low, when I'm alone 
I am the one who's blowing all he's got so get me some 

And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
And it's no better and its ok 
For every body in every way 
And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
Preservation, the only way 
For everybody and everyone 
I don't need no body, cause I am the one 

I am the one 

I am the punk who thinks that getting drunk is conversation 
I'll talk about the duplicate, it ends the complication 
I change my ways, just for today 
Right now, I need to run, I need to get away 

And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
And it's no better and its ok 
For every body in every way 
And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
Preservation, the only way 
For everybody and everyone 
I don't need no body, cause I am the one 

In the same old situation, make the most of the occasion 
And I feel as lame as anyone 
There's no answer to it and they can't prove it 
And I feel the same as anyone, as anyone 

And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
And it's no better and its ok 
For every body in every way 
And it's no better and it's no good 
I just don't shape up like I should 
Preservation, the only way 
For everybody and everyone 
For everybody and everyone 
For everybody and everyone 
I don't need no body, cause I am the one
