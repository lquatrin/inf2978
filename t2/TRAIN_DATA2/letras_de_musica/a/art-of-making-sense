There's an angel on the corner
And they say she's watching over
Over when we are under
Fall asleep on the ground

In all the times.
I to say tried you.
more never I will be equal.
without you.

In all the times.
I to say tried you.
more never I will be equal.
without you.

I gotta rock another city
I gotta break another country
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50
Or i'm deep in the ground

[Pre chorus:]
Hey
Not another bone for the pain
I'm never drinking again
It don't make sense when you're not around

[Chorus:]
In all the times.
I to say tried you.
more never I will be equal.
without you.

[Solo]

There's a devil on the road [x3]

[Pre chorus:]
I can feel it call your name
The feeling that's keeping me sane
Wide awake when you're not around

[Chorus:]
In all the times.
I to say tried you.
more never I will be equal.
without you.
