And i get frightened
When the phone rings
I leave the blinds closed
I got ten locks on my door
And i'm not waiting
For the weekends
And i'm not waking
For the mornings anymore

My life's a constant upward hill now
My life's a constant downward thrill

Another day
Another ordinary day

Another day
Another ordinary day

And its on and on forever on
But no one comes around
And you're under where without a care
But no one comes around

And all that money
For your cigarettes
A conversation becomes
Easy when you smoke
I'll kick 'em alright
Its a warning don't forget
A situation is so easy
When you're broke


My life's a constant upward hill now
My life's a constant downward thrill

Another day
Another ordinary day

Another day
Another ordinary day

And it's on and on forever on
But no one comes around
And your under where without a care
But no one comes around
Up above the stairs
That go nowhere
And no one comes around
And you're under where without a care

Ah

Come on

Together

Come on come on

Come out
