She leaves her footprints in the snow
She is the greatest thing I know
She is the coolest thing around
And when she walks she shakes the ground
She's got big hands
She's got long legs
She's got beautiful feet
Chorus:
And everything about her seems so wonderful
I wanna touch her just to see if she is real
She is the kind of girl I like
She never comes out in the light
She's got long hair
She's got big feet
She's got [...] teeth
Chorus
She is sasquatch (x20)
She's got big [...]
She's [...]
She's got beautiful teeth
Chorus
Just to see if she is real
Just to see if she is real
She's sasquatch
