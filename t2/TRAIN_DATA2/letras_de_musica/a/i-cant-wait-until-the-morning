Lets create some punk rock magic 

What have you done? 
What have you done? 

I don't feel up at all, i lost my shoe 
Down the corner got your name 
Nothing more could piss me off 
Like five nights in a travel lodge 
Rock the mic, not turned on 
Something tells me, somethings wrong 
This wont work, pen and ? 
Wish the time would travel faster 

I can't wait until the morning 
Went downstairs the telly's boring ? 
I can't wait until the morning 
Pack my bags and then i'm going 

Oh you've more brain that Steven Hawkin 
Just like him you shut up talking 
One more day and then i'm walking 
Your people skills are so appauling 
All the time i'm so alive 
Put me down, yeah you can try 
I'll take the book, I'll take the flight 
I've got something on my mind 

I can't wait until the morning 
Went downstairs the telly's boring? 
I can't wait until the morning 
Pack my bags and then I'm going 

What have you done? 
What have you done? 
What have you done?
