Started with a headache,
I tried to fight it but I kinda like the pain.
Reservations what I got,
From the bottom to the top of a bottle five times a day.
Started with a top line,
You know ItÂ’s gonna hurt when I close my eyes.
And IÂ’m shaking and I feel so alive.

Stand up and face it. Get out, donÂ’t waste it.
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?

Bored out of your mind, fighting all the time.
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen to you?

When thereÂ’s nothing onÂ…

You find yourself caught in a spotlight,
To try to fight but you candle light the place.
On your knees is what youÂ’re not, Keeping what you got.
DonÂ’t try to hide your face,
Caught in a flashlight.
You know ItÂ’s gonna hurt when I close my eyes.
And IÂ’m breaking and I feel so alright,
Stand up and face it. Get out donÂ’t waste it.
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?

Bored out of your mind, fighting all the time.
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen?
WhatÂ’s the worst thing that can happen to you?
