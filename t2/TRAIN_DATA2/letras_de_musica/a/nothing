Nothing

And nothing's where you're at

When you ain't got something

You'll never get it back

It's coming on like a drug

The universal power of one

But it don't mean nothing

If it all comes undone



Fly away

If you fly away

You might die today

If you fly

Fly



Gimme some love

Gimme some skin

If we ain't got that then we ain't got much

And we ain't got nothing

x2



You're left with nothing

And nothing's what you've got

When you ain't got no-one, no-one

You could have had the lot

And if it's over today

You'll never get that thing you had together, no way

You only get it once



Fly away

If you fly, fly



Gimme some love

Gimme some skin

If we ain't got that then we ain't got much

And we ain't got nothing

x2



We ain't got nothing x2

A day's a number

Don't remember how you found it

You will never feel the same

And forever have to take

It for granted, don't remember our mistake



Gimme some love

So gimme some skin

If we ain't got that then we ain't got much

And we ain't got nothing, nothing
