I'm down on the floor, there's a man on the door 
He won't let me in 'cause he thinks he's the law 
He'll give me shout when he's figured it out 
Gotta pick up myself, what am I waiting for? 
It's never enough, it's never too late 
I reminded myself that I'm starting again 
You're telling me "never", it should be
"whenever" 

And while the world is swinging 
I feel like I don't fit in 
Don't even know the way 
Don't hear a word they say 
And all the money makin' 
Oh, I just want to have a go 
I'm always up on time, man 
Why can't I be just like the people that I know? 

I've got what it takes, I'm bang up to date 
You know how it is, I'm all over the place 
Kicked in the face, I'm backstage 
Everyone here is half of my age 
Standing in line, I'm hitching a ride 
I'll give it a try but I dont have the time 
You're telling me "never", it should be
"whenever" 

And while the world is swinging 
I feel like I don't fit in 
Don't even know the way 
Don't hear a word they say 
And all the money makin' 
Oh, I just want to have a go 
I'm always up on time, man 
Why can't I be just like the people that I know? 

Ohhhh... 

Na na na na na (etc.) 
You're telling me "never", it should be
"whenever" 

And while the world is swinging 
I feel like I don't fit in 
Don't even know the way 
Don't hear a word they say 
And all the money makin' 
Oh, I just want to have a go 
I'm always up on time, man 
Why can't I be just like the people that I know? 

And while the world is swinging 
I feel like I don't fit in 
Don't even know the way 
Don't hear a word they say 
And all the money makin' 
Oh, I just want to have a go 
I'm always up on time, man 

I'm always up on time, man (Repeat)
