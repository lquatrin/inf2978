Whoo 
Lovin' your smile 
Lovin' your style 
Don't you get it? 
Got what I need 
You gotta believe 
I'm already yours 
Let your heart do all the talking (hoo!) 
Give it a shot 
Give what ya got 
Take me flyin' 
Give me your lips 
Give me the kiss 
I've been dyin' for 
Let your heart do all the talking 

Take my hand 
Understand 
That dreams can come true 

[CHORUS] 
And all you gotta do 
Is to go, is to flow 
With emotion, you 
Gotta know, gotta show, 
The devotion 
I just wanna be close to you 
(in the sunshine) 
Wherever the sun shines 
(in the rain) 
Wherever you go 
Let your heart do all the talking 

You're makin' a mistake 
You're makin' me shake 
With desire 
Don't need a break 
Don't wanna wait 
'Til the fires gone 
Let your heart do all the talking 
Get in the game 
Get in the zone 
Get in the action 
There's really no shame in letting me know that I'm the one (yeah) 
Let your heart do all the talking 

Take my hand 
Understand 
That dreams can come true 

[CHORUS] 

Let your heart do all the talking [x2] 

Now finish what you've started 
Because you brought it 
There ain't no better time 
Don't be so chicken-hearted 
If you want it 
Lay down the line 

[CHORUS x2
