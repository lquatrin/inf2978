You got away, you're doing it for me
You got to say, you're starting to bore me
So I bring in me band, and none of you want me
And this in't the first time, and this in't the last time
Sick of him, sick of you (We're equal)
Sick of you, sick of me (We're equal)
Sick of you, I'm sick of all of your people
We're equal, we're equal
You got a day, you got a story
You got a way, and there's always time for me
So I bring in me band, but you ignore me
And this in't the first time, and this in't the last time
Sick of him, sick of you (We're equal)
Sick of you, sick of me (We're equal)
Sick of you, I'm sick of all of your people
We're equal, I wish you would go
Sick of him, sick of you (We're equal)
Sick of you, sick of me (We're equal)
We're equal, we're equal
We're equal, we're equal
You're the man, you got a story
And you got a plan, you don't involve me
You say it's not true, you finally want me
And this in't the first time, and this in't the last time
Sick of him, sick of you (We're equal)
Sick of you, you're sick of me (We're equal)
We're equal, we're equal
We're equal, we're equal
We're equaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!!!
