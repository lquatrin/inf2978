don't fly into the sun
- your wings will melt and you'll come down"
I say you never know until you try
Away i go to the sun
I'm waving to the ground
I'll see you later


Chorus:
I will go - i will try
Anything one time and i
Never say never - why should i?
I will try - and i will go
Anywhere - never say
Never say never ask why


Who knows tomorrow may never come


I can't conceive the day
I fear the unknown - not me
I dream
Of open windows


And if you never fly your wings are useless


Chorus:
I will go - i will try
Anything one time and i
Never say never - why should i?
I will fly - and i will go
Anywhere - never say
Never say never ask why
