A little gurl growing up 
Needs some more attention 
A little boy growing up 
Needs some more rock and roll 

Fly away on the highway now 
Speed the gear before you change your mind 
And turn on the radio 
To hear kurt cobain rocking up the station yea 

If this the way you want 
Chocolate fish i'll show you everything.. 

* gonna be there with you 
forever we will be 
gonna be there with you 
forever we will be 
yea... 

A teenage gurl with a movie star 
Drying up in conversation 
A skater boy with tattoo arms 
Breaking down another rule 

Hide away on your wedding day 
And leave someone to take your place 
Rage up the town and get some recognition 
yea 

If this the way you want 
Chocolate fish i'll give you everything 
( Repeat *) 

Safety streets turning like a desert hot 
Time getting longer day and night 
Watching all the ground you drop 
This chocolate fish yea.. 
yea.. yea.. 
( Repeat * twice)
