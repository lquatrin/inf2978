We drove trough a cloud 
and danced in the rain on mountain tops
Looking down to the world below our feet
But you don't see me anymore

I can't beleive what was said 
The night after we fought for the 1000th time
You looked at me with tears stuck in your eyes
You don't see me anymore

I never thought I would be 
So moved by the dreams I've had of you
Everytime I close my eyes, it's so hard for me to sleep

So I lie awake forever
I can't see you anymore
So I lie awake forever
(I can't see you anymore)

YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying, 
the way I did before)
YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying,
'cause you don't see me anymore)

Out of sight , out of mind
Is that what it feels like this time?
You were flawed, you were wrong- but so was I

Show me faith, show me love
I don't know what happened to us
But I still believe, we have another try.


So I lie awake forever
I can't see you anymore
So I lie awake forever
(I can't see you anymore)

YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying, 
the way I did before)
YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying,
'cause you don't see me anymore)

All I've ever wanted
Is what you could'nt give
All I've ever wanted
Is what you could'nt give

YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying, 
the way I did before)
YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME(and I feel as though I'm dying,
'cause you don't see me anymore)
