I cannot live on bread alone,
but when I get a piece of you, it's all about me.
I cannot do this on my own.
If this fog would clear I'd see you reaching for me.

I've taken up my cross, yeah one more time
and still I try to find a better way.

Well I can take this no more 
and I can't break unless I'm bending.
and I can't go away if you're not there too.
Is this life you've given me another way of showing your love?

I cannot live on bread alone,
but when I get a piece of you, it's all about me.
Today it's you the sun shines on. 
I should rejoice and be glad but it's all about me.

I've taken up my cross, yeah one more time
and still I try to find a better way.
