Open up the book you beat me with again.
Read it off one sentence at a time.
I'm tired of all the lines, convictions, and your lies.
What right do you have to point at me?

Now I'm sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee.
Still crowding my space are the things that you still hold against me.
You cannot save me.

No, I cannot fill the void with what you're shoving on me.
If you don't know the truth, how can you say you know me?
If all this is wrong, I'll find out on my own.
So don't kill me inside, I'm trying to LIVE!

I'm trying to live.
How is this helping me?
I'm trying to live, trying to live.

Read it all, no need for seperating here.
You see what you want and try to justify
All your little lines, convictions, and your lies.
What right do you have to point at me?

Now I'm sitting alone thinking about it all over coffee.
Still crowding my space are the things that you still hold against me.
You cannot save me.

No, I cannot fill the void with what you're shoving on me.
If you don't know the truth, how can you say you know me?
If all this is wrong, I'll find out on my own.
So don't kill me inside, I'm trying to LIVE!

I'm trying to live.
How is this helping me?
I'm trying to live, trying to live.
