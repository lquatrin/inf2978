The rain falls down, falls on me
The rain falls down, your blue sky turns to gray

Open up, let me find a way in
Open up, let me find a way in and...

Let go all the pain you put me through
Let go all the sin that brings me in
Let go all the pain you seem to put yourself through
Let go all the sin that pulls you in
Won't you...let me in?

The same that goes 'round, comes back at me
The blame, gets pushed around at times. Am I too proud to sat it's mine?

Open up let me find a way in
Open up, let me find a way in and...

Let go all the pain you put me through
Let go all the sin that brings me in
Let go all the pain you seem to put yourself through
Let go all the sin that pulls you in
Won't you ...let me in?

Well it's only me, so why won't you let me see in
Well, it's only me, it's only me so let me ....

Let go all the pain you put me through
Let go all the sin that brings me in
Let go all the pain you seem to put yourself through
Let go all the sin that pulls you in
Won't you ...let me in?
