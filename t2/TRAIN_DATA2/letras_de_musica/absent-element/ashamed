I've changed all I can change.
everything else can stay the same.
I've changed all I can change for you.
you've given me a name.
I found myself inside the flames,
becoming everything for you.
I'ts not like it was before,
but you're still asking me for more.

That's all I can give to you.
That's all I can give away.
That's all I can give to you.
I don't feel ashamed.

The pressure is building now,
but I can't say that I know how
to turn this all around again.
You know everything.
So I listen once again 
to the words you say to me in vain.
