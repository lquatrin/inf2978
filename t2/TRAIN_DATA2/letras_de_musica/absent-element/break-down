Nothing feels the same, no
Another lost saturday
My stupid side shows up and then...
Three steps, the wrong way.

And now that your gaurd's down, ya get
Another slap in the face
You get closer to me and then...
Three steps, the wrong way.

Well it's not the time to break down.
It's not the time to break down.

You've given up on me today,
For now and all the times like these.
Showing me the door always
gets me to thinking,

'bout all those times you were there for me.
All the times I felt so weak.
I was nowhere to be found when you...
When you were sinking!

Well it's not the time to break down.
It's not the time to break up this love.
Keep it together now.
Well it's not the time to break down.
It's not the time to break.....DOWN!!!
