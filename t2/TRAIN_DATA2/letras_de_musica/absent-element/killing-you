You see the scar in my side.
I've tasted pain of candy thorns.
There is no scar that I can hide.
They're on my sleeve tattered and worn.

I need you here with me, but you seem so far away.
You seem so far away.

I'm killing you again.
I didn't wanna see the tears in your eyes. 
Should've seen what could become,
but i had to see you breaking inside. 
Your back's against the wall again. 
There's gotta be a way of stopping myself
from killing you again, killing you again.

The walls are closing in on you.
All you are has been lost through what I have become.
I keep on going with blinded eyes, but on the outside
looking in I can see just who I am.

I need you here with me, but you seem so far away.

I'm feeling so alone...cause I've pushed you far away.
