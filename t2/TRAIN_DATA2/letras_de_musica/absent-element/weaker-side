Easy, too easy 
to give in to the words that you say.
Stupid, how stupid
I must have been.
Every time, every time
I look into those eyes, I see lies
So close them now, close them now 
the truth will rise.

Where did I go wrong?

Need time to clear my head
Time to remember the one who keeps me here
'cause evertime I hold them up,
They end up dragging me down.
The weaker side of me

Cover me, you cover me
with what I want, it aint what I need
Take it off, take it off
it's too hard to breathe.
Devil eyes shine into mine
and now ya know I'm going blind.
Go away, so go away
You're killing me.

Where did I go wrong?

Need time to clear my head
Time to remember the one who keeps me here
'cause evertime I hold them up,
They end up dragging me down.
The weaker side of me
The weaker side of me
The weaker side of me
Where did I go wrong?
