I'm so wrongly accused, pinned down and abused,
by all that you do to bring me closer.

You're the one that I despise, you cannot deny.
You tell another lie. You don't know how to die.
You're just another thorn in my side.

Silence fills this chamber you built to hold me in, 
as you find your home underneath my skin.
You offer me gold and silver for my sins, but your
eye candy will never suck me in.

You're the one that I despise, you cannot deny.
You tell another lie. You don't know how to die.

Nothing's wrong now and now you're leaving me nowhere
for me to hide the thorn in my side.

You're the one that I despise,you cannot deny.
You tell another lie. You don't know how to die.
You look me in the eye, no longer will I cry.
Now you're leaving me nowhere for me to hide
the thorn in my side.
