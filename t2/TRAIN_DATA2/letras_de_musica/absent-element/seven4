Take a glance
Unfortunate circumstance
Never seem to take a chance
As I sit and watch you dance
I sit here like a fool

Why I can't 
Cannot seem to understand
What it takes to be a man
Get back up and breathe again
I will not be your fool

will you tell me...WHY?!!

Is it enough now, to love me?
Is it enough now, to hate me?
Tell me, is it enough now....

Remembering
That I won't amount to anything
I think that's what you said to me
Theres gotta be much more for me
Than what you're offering

Break away
From everthing I've heard you say
So much has changed from yesterday
And now ya don't know what to say
when you stand in front of me.

will you tell me...WHY?!!

Is it enough now, to love me?
Is it enough now, to hate me?
Tell me, is it enough now....
