Take a look at me.
What have i become?
I don't like what I am seeing.
Selfishness and greed make it hard to breath.
When I'm feeling suffocated, I feel the need to...

Run away, run away from my home.
I feel the need to run.

Take a look at you.
I can't live up to your self and perfection.
I know it's hard to see,
but it's all a part of me.
I feel like I can face this, but instead I...

Run away, run away from my home.
I feel the need to run.
Fallen, fallen short of your grace.
Pick me up, I'm on my face.

Breathe again, live again...
You would say follow me, follow me
to breathe again, to live agin... to live again.
