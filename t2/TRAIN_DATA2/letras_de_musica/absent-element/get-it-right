Everytime I look to the sky,
the sun burns holes into my eyes.
Everytime I ask for relief from my pain
I get beaten again.

I ask myself will I...
EVER GET IT RIGHT?

It's this disease I can't cure,
but the reward is worth living for.
You said it yourself that I'm insane.
Expecting things to change, when I remain the same.

I ask myself will I...
EVER GET IT RIGHT?

Pushing you shoving me
Shoving me!!!

I ask myself will I...
EVER GET IT RIGHT?
