Sometimes I feel a little insecure.
Sometimes I feel my intentions never pure.
Right now I fear that I won't be good enough.
I get like this every now and then.
my knees are bruised when times are tough.

Hurry up before it's too late.
Take my hand before it's too late.
I used to feel like the fish you were trying to catch...

But now I feel like the bait.
The knots in my rope unravel in my grip.
Trying so hard to climb up but I still slip.
The world that surrounds me biting at my skin.
Your hook's in my mouth, I feel like I'm drowning,
the mouth of my pride is about to take me in.

Can you save me?
