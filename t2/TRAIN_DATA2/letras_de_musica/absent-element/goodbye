I never knew you, but I wish I would've known. 
I would've liked to have seen that side of you.
So what if I would've been around you more, 
given you more love, would you be here? 
Now there's a life that you've left me here to raise.

And I never got to say goodbye to you.
I never got to say goodbye.
And I never got to say goodbye to you.
So I'm saying hello to you, I'm saying I wish you were here.

We could have been friends. Could've been closer than this.
But circumstances keep us far apart. 
What you've given me is more than i could've asked.
Divided lives joined by the same son.
I wish I had the peace of knowing where you are,

Cause I never got to say goodbye to you.
I never got to say goodbye. 
And I never got to say goodbye to you.
So I'm saying hello to you, I'm saying I wish you were here.

This life that you left me here to raise,
I won't take for granted what you've given me.
They all tried to drag you down and walk on you, 
and they pulled you to the ground.

IN MEMORY OF ANDRE RUFF
3/14/76 - 3/13/03
YOU WILL BE MISSED.
