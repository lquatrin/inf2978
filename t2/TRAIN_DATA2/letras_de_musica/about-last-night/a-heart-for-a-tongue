I know what you told me. 
I know what you said. 
That you wouldn't wait on me forever. 

I'll sleep on your front porch. 
Anything I could, just to win you back. 
I would have stood at your front door. 
But that was before I had to ask myself... 

Is it love that keeps my bleeding heart, 
or love that makes it bleed? 
Cause love can be an amazing thing, 
'Til hate is what you need. 
So drag me through your pool of lies, 
Until my skin turns black. 
Cause then my skin will be like your heart. 
They'll be the perfect, 
Be the perfect match. 

They'll be the perfect match. 
I wanna cut my tongue out. 
It reminds me, 
I kissed you and I didnt mean it. 

So in this dual we pretned to call love- 
I'll be your right leg, you'll be the left, 
We'll stand back to back 
Then count our steps away. 
'Til I can see whats comming next. 
He'll move in, 
Grab a bite, then ask for, 
He'll ask for the, 
He'll ask for the, 
He'll ask for the, check. 

Yeah he'll ask for the check. 

I wanna cut my tongue out. 
It reminds me, 
I kissed you and I didnt mean it. 

Said im not the one, im not the one, 
you've been looking for. 
I'm not. 
Said im not the one, im not the one, 
you've been looking for. 

I'm not the one, im not the one, 
im not the one, im not the one, 
youve been looking for, 
looking for. 
I wanna cut my tongue out. 
It reminds me, 
I kissed you and I didnt mean it.
