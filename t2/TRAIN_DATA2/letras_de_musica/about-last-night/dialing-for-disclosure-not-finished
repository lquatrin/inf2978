Hello caller who'll be your number 

Does it even matter how hard we try? 
Does it even matter how hard we fight? 
Cause were on again 
Were off again 
Were on again 
were off again 
You're on again 
You're off with him 

I'm getting tired of getted used to missing you, 
and the smell of his cologne is getting old too. 
A life time of pain shoved into a few minutes. 
Who'll repair my heart from the holes you left in it? 

Hello caller he'll be your number one, 
and hello caller he'll be there when you call. 
He was the problem and I was the mess, 
So you swallowed your problems 
and choked us to death. 
And i'l never get the answers 
To the questions that I'll never ask. 

Whisper confessions. Your lips burn to speak. 
They're speaking of your thoughts, wispering of deceit. 
Say I lied again. 
You can trust me on this one. 
You'd take my hand and weigh you down 
By lying by omission. 

We'll bury our love right where we dug it up, 
In that internet chatroom where we fell in love. 
And on our grave, instead of two lovers 
"In remembrance of us torn apart by another."

(sex noises throughout) 
I'm getting tired, of getting used 
Getting tried of getting used 
I'm getting tired, of getting used 
Getting tried of getting used 
Getting tired 

I'm getting tired of getting used to missing you. 

You
