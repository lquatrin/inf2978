As I walk across your battlefield, 
all I see are broken hearts. 
You lift your sword, 
it acts just like your tongue. 
Speaking its words 
into my demise. 
it speaks out 
as i bleed out. 

And its said that all is fair but 
Love is war, love is war. 
So will you fight, fight for me or die? 
will you die? Die, well you died. 

And you smile in my face 
as you stab me in the back. 
And your kiss goodbye 
won't be mine this time. 
I'd rather die than take second place in 
this race of romance. 

Its said that all is fair but 
love is war, love is war. 
Will you fight, fight for me or die? 
will you die? Die, well you died. 

Your goodbye, your goodbye kiss, wasnt mine. 
(your goodbye, your goodbye kiss, your goodbye, your goodbye kiss) 

Repeats
