Every day I try to see 
the closeness that your promised me, 
fades away, 
it fades away. 

Every night I try to dream 
of what you wanted me to be, 
in your life, 
in your life. 

Every dawn the light that wakes you up 
will remind you of my touch. 
that you miss so much. 

What if i died tomorrow? 
would you miss me here? 
What if i cried tomorrow? 
Would you shed your tears? 

Every time you think about 
the things you said 
remind yourself im gone. ( im gone) 

I hope you take this as a lesson learned. 
Tomorrow isn't promised (nothing's promised.) 

Every hour, every day gone by, 
you'll cry for me, 
you'll cry for me. 

What if I died tomorrow? 
would you miss me here? 
What if I cried tomorrow? 
Would you shead your tears? 

A story's just been told that has happened yet. 
Just a tragic foreshadowing 
of what could happen to you. 

Think before you speak, 
it could be the last time ( the last time) 
you ever speak to him. 

What if I died tomorrow? 
would you miss me here? 
What if I cried tomorrow? 
Would you shead your tears? 

A story's just been told that has happened yet. 
Just a tragic foreshadowing 
of what could happen...
