You've been asking me 
for closure to a story that has no, 
a story that has no ending. 

I know you dont want to hear this, 
so I'll try to keep it brief. 
Try to keep my tongue from twisting, 
try to practice what I preach. 
And I only have 9 words to say. 
I hope 
you'll hear me out, 
I hope you'll hear me out. 

I hope you find God, 
before he finds you. 
I hope 
I hope 

I hope you the best, 
that only God can give you. 
I hope 
I hope 

So you're looking through your books and logic, 
you wont find the answers love. 
It's just not there, no. 
It's just not there, no. 
And words can be like razors, 
slashing away at the wrists of our hearts. 

I hope you find God, 
before he finds you. 
I hope 
I hope 

I hope you the best, 
that only God can give you. 
I hope 
I hope 


I hope you find God, 
before he finds you. 
I hope 
I hope 


I hope you find God, 
before he finds you. 
I hope 
I hope 

I hope you the best, 
that only God can give you. 
I hope 
I hope 

I hope.
