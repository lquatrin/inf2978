I remember days when we were younger
We used to catch O'opv in the mountain stream
'Round the Ko'olav hills we'd ride on horseback
So long ago it seems it was a dream

Last night I dreamt I was returning 
And my heart called out to you
But I fear you won't be like I left you
Me Kealoha Kv'v Home O Kahalvv

I remember days when we were wiser 
When our world was small enough for dreams
And you have lingered there my sister
and I no longer can it seems

Last night I dreamt I was returning 
And my heart called out to you
But I fear I am not as I left you
Me Kealoha Kv'v Home O Kahalvv

Change is the strangest thing, it cannot be denied
It can help you find yourself or make you lose your pride

Move with it slowly for on the road we go
Please do not hold on to me we all must go alone

I remember days when we were smiling
when we laughed and sang the whole night long
And I greet you as I find you 
With the sharing of a brand new song

Last night I dreamt I was returning
And my heart called out to you
To please accept me how you find me
Me Kealoha Kv'v Home O Kahalvv
Me Kealoha Kv'v Home O Kahalvv
Me Kealoha Kv'v Home O Kahalvv
