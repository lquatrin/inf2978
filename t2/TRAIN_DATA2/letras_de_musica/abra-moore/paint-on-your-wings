Paint on your wings, it's time to fly.
Red gold and green, Daddy, the color you like.
Waiting for you
Waiting for you to let it all go, to give up this fight
You're finally gonna know what's on the other side.
And the day turns into night as the light falls from your eyes.
Taking away the cup that's keeping you alive.
Done everything we could, it's time to stop trying.
Finally free.
Paint on your wings, it's time to fly.
Red gold and green, Daddy, the colors you like.
Waiting for you
Waiting for you to let it all go to give up the fight.
You're finally gonna know what's on the other side.
