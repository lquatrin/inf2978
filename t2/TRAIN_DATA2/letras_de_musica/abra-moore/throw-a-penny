Speak easy when you speak of leaving here
Try not to talk to loud yeah
Take your time when you walk away from here
Try not to take too long yeah

Somtimes this love feels just like a big wheel
It keeps turning, turning down the avenue
Sometimes it goes up sometimes we go down
Sometimes we just dont know what to feel
For our love is only perfect for a very short time

So I'll, I'll let you go
And I'll, I'll watch you fall
And I'll, I'll push you deeper than
You've ever been pushed before

For our love is only perfect for a very short time
Said our love it's only perfect

So come on throw another penny down the river bed
We'll see if it comes out shining and bright
Throw another penny down the river bed
We'll see if it comes out shining and bright

And I'll, I'll let you go
And I'll, I'll watch you fall
And I'll, I'll push you deeper than
you've ever been pushed before

Throw another penny down the river bed
See if it comes out shining
You've ever been pushed before
Throw another penny down the river bed
See if it comes out shining (fades)
