You're traveling through my head again 
I pull you out every once in a while 
Just to look at you 
To lay with you 
To remember how it used to be 

Burning streetlights, setting our hearts on fire 
Tipping the bottle, leaving our heads spinning 
Clinging tight now under the noonday sun 
You won't let me go free 

Every once in a while 

Weaving a lover in the palm of my hand 
Running that river, making my head go round 
Dripping teardrops fallin from the sky 
Keeping the tides easy 

Every once in a while 

Touch and go 
Like a wet fish dripping from my fingertips 
You move me.
