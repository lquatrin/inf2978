Dream Time 
Abra Moore 
In dream time
I sleep a thousand years
A thousand clouds 
Pass through my eyes 
Making sunlight disappear

In dream time
I cross to the other side
Cross the fields of gravity
Where angels like to fly

hey hey
I know you and you
hey hey hey

Closer
I'm getting so much closer
To the fall
Thats how i sleep at night
Between the pillows and the floor boards
Across to the other side
Along the spinning wheels of yesterdays
Where memories sometimes collide

In dream time
I will sleep a thousand years
A thousand clouds
Pass through my eyes 
Making sunlight disappear

Closer
I'm getting so much closer
To the fall
Closer
To the fall
Closer
To the fall
Thats how i sleep at night

A thousand clouds
And a thousand clouds
A thousand crows pull out my hair
Casting shadows upon my wall
