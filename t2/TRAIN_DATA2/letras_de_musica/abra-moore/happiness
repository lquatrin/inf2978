I didn't know it could feel like this 
I didn't know the hurt 
And I try to explain to myself 
But I can't find no word 

So I lie about it 
And I tell 'em I'm feeling fine 
And I'll cry about it 
Hoping tomorrow will change my mind 

Happiness has come to this 
And God, it's such a heavy burden to bear 

I didn't know it could be like this 
I didn't know it could go so far 
And I try to reveal the part of me 
But you can't find no scar 

And I lie about it 
And I tell 'em I'm feeling fine 
And I cry about it 
Hoping tomorrow will change my mind 

Happiness has come to this 
And God, it's such a heavy burden to bear
