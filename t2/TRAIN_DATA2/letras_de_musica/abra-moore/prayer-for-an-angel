Don't tie the string so tight 
she'll never slip away from you
She tried
A broken wing don't fly

A kiss, a kiss to say goodbye
To a world you used to know

I watch you chase her down
Away from you

Hope, hope is all you've got 
You've forgotten how to find your way
But, can you hear her cry
Over you

Don't tie the string so tight 
she'll never slip away from you
She tried
A broken wing don't fly.
