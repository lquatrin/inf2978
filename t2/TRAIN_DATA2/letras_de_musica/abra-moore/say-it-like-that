Say that you like that 
Say that you would, say you will 
Say all the things that you never could 
Say what you want, say what you feel 
Tell it to me like that, tell it to me light, tell it to me right 
Could you tell it to me real this time 
Tell me how you plan to take me 
And how you're planning to steal my heart away 

Holding your breath again, you're holdin' on, holdin' on 
I can feel it 
Holding your breath again, someday you're gonna have to let it go 
You've got me hiding behind your blue curtain, blue curtain of love 
You've got me hiding behind your blue curtain, blue curtain of love 

I wish it could be all that easy and free 
Wish it could, wish it could 
We could break down all these lines 
Break 'em down, break 'em down 
So I keep all my treasures in this big old box 
Let me show them to you, to you 

Say that you like that 
Say that you would, say you will 
Say all the things that you never could 
Say what you want, say what you feel 
Tell it to me like that, tell it to me light, tell it to me right 
Could you tell it to me real this time 
Tell me how you plan to take me 
And how you're planning to steal my heart away 

I wish it could be all that easy and free 
Wish it could, wish it could 
We could break down all these lines 

Say that you like that 
Say that you would, say you will 
Say all the things that you never could 
Say what you want, say what you feel 
Tell it to me like that, tell it to me light, tell it to me right 
Could you tell it to me real this time 
Tell me how you plan to take me 

And how you're planning to steal my heart away 

Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
Ooh la lay 
Just like that
