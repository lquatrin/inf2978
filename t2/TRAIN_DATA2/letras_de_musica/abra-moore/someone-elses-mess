If I loved you, would you like that?
Would you have me on my front or on my back?
I used to like that.
If I trust you would it matter
Would you care more if I showed you what I hide?
And let you inside.
Please don't ask me cause it's not you.
The careless things I say and do
That cause this stress
But this is someone else's mess
Can I kiss you, can I try to make you laugh?
Can I have you on my floor or in my bath
I used to like that.
Please don't ask me cause it's not you.
The careless things I say and do
That cause this stress
But this is someone else's mess
Someone else's mess
Someone else's
Someone else's
Someone else's mess
If I loved you would you like that?
Would you have me on my front or on my back?
I used to like that, yeah.
I used to like that, yeah.
Someone else's mess
