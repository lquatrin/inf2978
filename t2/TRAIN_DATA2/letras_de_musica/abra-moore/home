Hey

What's your name?

And do you live around here?

Now don't I know your face?

You say I've been a stranger for too long

And I didn't even notice I was gone

But I want to come back home



Show me the way to make a start

You show me the road back to your heart

And I've learned the only truth that I need to know

There's a million places I can go

But without you it ain't home



Please say

What i need to hear you say

Say I'm thoughtless and foolish

And say it's not too late

Now I don't know exactly where we go from here

But trying is the only way we'll know

And I want to come back home



Show me the way to make a start

Show me the road back to your heart

And I've learned the only truth that I need to know

There's a million places I can go

But without you it ain't home



It ain't hopeless please believe me

Don't give up because you're halfway there

You're at the crossroads in the middle

Between home, between despair

All we need is some direction

Let me know you'll wait for me

Because where you are

Is where I'll be



Show me the way to make a start

Show me the road back to your heart

And I've learned the only truth that I need to know

There's a million places I can go

But without you it ain't home



No, it ain't home
