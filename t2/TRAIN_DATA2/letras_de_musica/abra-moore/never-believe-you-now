You're telling me the future plans 
Where candy-colored pictures fill your hands 
And for a minute I am with you there 
And I'm picking out some pretty dress to wear 

But I'll never believe you now 
I never believed you then 
Shame 

I know a place where summers shine 
And every fairy tale comes real before my eyes 
And the stories that you always tell 
Well, they never held together well 

And I'll never believe you now 
I never believed you then 
And I'll never believe you now 

Could you look at you now 
And what it's doing to me 
Broken pieces of what used to be 

But I'll never believe you now 
I never believed you then 
Shame 

Could you look at you now 
And what it's doing to me 
Broken pieces of what used to be
