I've tried my damnedest to get near you 
My ears are bleeding trying to hear you 
I'm lost in the middle of a cold rain 
And you're forests away 

Every state I've ever been 
Has greeted me with a bad beginning 
I stand in the pathway of a fast train 
To swing you my way 

I look around and nobody's there 
I look around and nobody cares 
I look around and nobody's there 

I try to keep myself contained 
I watch TV ignore the pain 
But every night like an army on a foray 
My thoughts do invade 

I look around and nobody's there 
I look around and nobody cares 
I look around and nobody's there 

You don't believe that I've been through hell 
Cause I'm pretty together and doing well 
You don't believe that I feel alone 
Cause the people that pass me say hello 

I look around and nobody's there 
I look around and nobody cares 
I look around and nobody's there
