I sleep all day, what makes me feel this way.
When everything's a bust, when everything keeps loosing my trust.
Where do we begin with this unhappy ending.
Where do we begin after all that we've done.
How do we begin to say I forgive you
And how do we begin to repair this family affair.
I think about the neverending way that my day never seems to want to end
I think about the loneliness of loosing a friend.
Don't take it away from me
Don't take away the one love that matters.
And I'll get well you'll see.
Your all I have, you're my family.
Is their ever enough love, ever enough.
Where do we begin picking up the pieces.
Where do we begin after all that's been said.
And how do we begin to say I still love you.
And how do we begin to repair this family affair.
Don't take it away from me
Don't take away the one love that matters.
And we'll get well, you'll see
We're all we have, we're family, family.
Where do we begin.
