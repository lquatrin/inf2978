And I'll meet you in the middle
And I'll crawl to the edge
And I'll stand there forever
Just to see if i can
And I'll cry a river as I lay in your bed cos I need you like I need the rain
And I need you like I need the man
And I need you like I never needed anything before

Cos we're just running wild and young
Was only just for fun
This melancholy love

But I'll see you there
In your the midtown square
And I'll see you there
And I just won't care
And I'll hold you down
But never let you fall

Cos we're just running wild and young
Was only just for fun
This melancholy love

Could you tell me why I feel so sad about it
Could you tell me why...

But I'll meet you in the middle
And I'll crawl to the edge
And I'll stand there forever
Just to see if I can
And I'll cry a river as I lay in your bed

Cos we're just running wild and young
Was only just for fun
This melancholy love

Yeh we were running wild and young
Was only just for fun
Wasn't it
This melancholy love
Could you tell me why... I feel so sad about it
Could you tell me why... I feel so sad about it
Could you tell me why... I feel so sad about it
Could you tell me why... i feel so sad about it
