Hey, I hear you're back 
Well here don't you want your guitar back 
Why, I really don't know for sure 
And what it is I'm asking for 

See the wood it's slowly fading 
But the bridge I fixed it new 
I took it downtown to the guitar man 
He said he'd do the best, the best that he can 
And you know how it was then 
I thought it couldn't last 
I thought it was stronger 

It's a mighty fine day to play 
three chords is all I have to say 
I slip down the road 
And the melody's got such a terrible hold on me 
It's taking me back, taking me back 

I keep it in a glass 
In case of fire 

Hey, why is it taking you so long
