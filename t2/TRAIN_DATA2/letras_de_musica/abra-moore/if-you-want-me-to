If you want me to
I'll lie about the way it really feels
And if you want me to
I'll turn back around and forget the whole deal

But I wanted you
And I thought that you wanted me too
Sometimes signals get crossed
And love gets lost

But if you want me to
I'll just pretend that you didn't mean a thing to me
Deep inside my room
I hold back the tear that I'll never let you see

Because I followed you
Just the way that you wanted me to
You reached out your hand and took hold

Then you let go

I've fallen in love with you
And it just burns
But what else can I do?

If you want me to
I'l lie about the the way it really feels
And if you want me to
I'll turn back around and forget the whole deal

But I wanted you
And I thought that you wanted me too
Sometimes signals get crossed
Sometimes feelings get lost
