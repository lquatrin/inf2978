This is the end, I just know it.
No reason to pretend anymore, it's what you've always wanted.
I watch you through my rearview as I drive away.
Your image not so clear now, it's better this way Oh
And all I can do is wish you the best
And all I can do anymore that's all I have left.
You've been telling me for a year now how we don't get along.
I'm starting to believe you, you're right, everything's wrong
And it's too late to get it back, it's too late to get it back.
This is the end, I just know it.
No reason to pretend anymore, it's what you've always wanted.
I took down all your pictures, it helps me with the pain.
Things are getting clearer, it gets better everyday Oh.
