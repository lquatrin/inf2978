What if I just let it all out, what if I just put it all down.
What if I twist and shout and can't stand to see you around.
As blind as I am, as cruel as you are.
I always thought you'd be my shining star.
What if I wish you wish you well
What if I never never sell
What if I keep your heart and pretend I can't tell.
As blind as I am, as cruel as you are
Should have known we'd never get too far.
You'll always be my little shining star,
No matter what or where you are.
You'll always be my little shining star
You keep calling me back to you
You keep calling me back
What are friends for, for.
What if I never leave this place
What if I dropped out of the race
What if I traveled around the world only see your face
Shining
You keep calling me back to you
You keep calling me back
What are friends for.
