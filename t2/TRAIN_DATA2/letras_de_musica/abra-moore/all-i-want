All I want is you 
All I need is you 
Liar liar in my bed 
Your filling up my pretty, pretty head 
You're telling me things that I want to hear 
I'm enraptured 

Fire in my heart 
You're tearing me, you're tearing me, you're me apart 
Showing me things that I want to feel 
I am captured 

This road's got to end soon 
See it's taking the better part of me 

Fire fire in my hear 
It's tearing me, it's trearing me, it's tearing me apart 
Telling me things I want to hear 
You've got me tellin' it my mind is set a reelin' 

I don't need some picture-framed photograph 
To save me 
When it keeps coming back to this 

All I want is you 
All I need is you 
My heart's a reelin' and I don't know what I'm feelin' 

I don't need some picture-framed photograph 
To save me 
When it keeps coming back to this 

All I want is you 
All I need is you 
Won't you give it to me 
Come on give it to me
