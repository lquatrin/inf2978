I needed to blame somebody
I wanted you to be the one that I needed to blame
Somebody
I wanted you to be the one

Sometimes the wind brushes me back
Sometimes I feel faint
And sometimes I just don't know

Be alone sweet life
The wind cries in my head, cries
Sometimes I wanna go

I wanna hold you up, hold you up high above me
I wanted you to be the one
I wanna lift you up, lift you up high in the sky
I wanted you to be the one

High....
