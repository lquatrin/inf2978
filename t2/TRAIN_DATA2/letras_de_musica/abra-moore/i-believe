Where is the laughter
where is the hopeful
where is that light that makes me sing

where is the courage
where is the faithful
where is that when beneath my wings

I can't get it back
my heart being flat
my color is black
I don't feel like I used to

something is that wrong
gotta make it right
when my day so long
gotta make it right

yea I know that it's gotta be me
that changes
yea I know it's gotta be me
that makes it

Coz I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe.. I believe

coz you give me an answer
coz you give me a sign
that you look this much does
make up my mind

you know what I'm after
it's gonna just take sometime..

I know that it's gotta be me
that changes
and I know it's gotta be me
that makes it

Coz I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe.. I believe

Where is the laughter
where is the hopeful
where is that light that makes me sing

where is the courage
where is the faithful
where is that when beneath my wings

Coz I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe...I believe
I believe.. I believe

...in love....

yea I believe...it's worth fighting for.
