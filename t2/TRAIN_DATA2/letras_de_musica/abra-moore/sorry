If I could hold you
You know I would
If the whole world would just stop turning
It would be real still
If I said IÂ’d meet ya after midnight
I know IÂ’d never did return
a lot of promises were broken
I never kept to my word
Ooooooh
And IÂ’m on my knees for you IÂ….
It feels like some Saturday cartoon
OhÂ…
If I could tell ya..yeah I waited up for you
Would you believe enough in magic and carnival wheels
Oo life is never say youÂ’re sorry
love is never make mistakes
Life is tellinÂ’ me the answer if I canÂ’t believe the ray/rain
I meant to tell ya IÂ’m sorry for all the hurt
and senseless pain
I need to tell you IÂ’m sorry
[Sorry lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]

for all the love we never got to make
Calling me back to the row on the hill
Shaded the light can be right
Ooooh ooh yeah
If I could hold you
You know I would
If my whole world would just stop turning and be real still
I said id meet ya after midnight
I know IÂ’d never did return
a lot of promises were broken
I never kept to my word
I need to tell you IÂ’m sorry
For everything that weÂ’ve been through
I need to tell ya
IÂ’m sorry yeah
for all the love I never gave back to you
IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry IÂ’m sorry
(ahhh yeah IÂ’m on my knees for you feels like some Saturday day cartoonÂ…)
Do do do do do do do do do do do
