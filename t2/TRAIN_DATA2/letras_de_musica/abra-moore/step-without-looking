Lying in my bed
The sun's pouring though
And all my thoughts
Go reeling back to you
Ask of me anything and I'll do it for you
Without question, I'll go where you take me to

And not until the end
Do we ask right or wrong
And it don't matter anyhow, it don't matter anyhow, and it don't matter anyhow, it don't matter anyhow

Step without looking
Come what may
Step without looking
Come what may

So if I seem a bit sober just turn and walk away
Cuz it has occurred to me and I've just got to say
That lovers don't have anything but bliss and pain
Bliss and pain and a vast desert in between

And distracted lovers so dutifully inclined
Just make me sad, so dutifully inclined
Let's make a pact, and cast it to the wind
To never let our bond, be infused or thinned
For the promise of love, is the deciever
But when your in its confidence, you've got to believe
That it could take you anywhere, and it could lead you anywhere, it could take you anywhere and it could lead you anywhere
Stripped of conviction
Naked and beaten
Stripped of conviction
Naked and beaten

Step without looking
Come what may
Step without looking
Come what may
