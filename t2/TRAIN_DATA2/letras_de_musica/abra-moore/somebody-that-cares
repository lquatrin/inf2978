When the past won't let you, leave behind all your yesterday
Remember times when you never could find that perfect word to say
Now your mind won't forget him,and the latest song just brings you down, down...
Remember your boy from the neighborhood, that sidewalk-smiling run around

You don't know why you're crying, and you don't know why you're dying inside
It seems the past won't let you ever fall in love again
It's time you let him go, for somebody that cares

Does he say he loves you, and does he play to win?
And does he leave a light on, when you're late getting in?

Now you can't keep leaving, trying to run from your feelings again
It seems your mind won't forget that undecided love affair

It's time you let him go, let him go, let him go, for somebody that cares
Does he say he loves you, and does he play to win?
Does he leave the light on when you're late getting in?
Day
