The road full of light 
I have mine 
Full of desire 

In all of the world 
There is a big mountain 
Full of green daffodils 
Swimming in the coldest part of spring 

In light of it all 
It comes pouring 
Some going this way and others that 
And straight down the track 
You can hear 'em all falling 

The road full of light 
I have mine 
Full of desire 
In the light of it all 
I have gone
