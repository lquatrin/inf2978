I go to the Rock, I go to the Rock
I go to the Rock, I go to the Rock
I know, I know He's able

Where do I go
When there's no body else to turn to
Who do I talk to
When no one wants to listen
Who do I lean on
When there's no foundation stable
I go to the Rock I know He's able
I go to the Rock

CHORUS
I go to the Rock of my Salvation
I go to the Stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me
When the earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, When I need a friend,
I go to the Rock

Where do I hide
When the storms of life are threatening
Where do I run to
When the winds of sorrow blow
Is there a refuge (a refuge) in the time of tribulation
Cause I go to the Rock
I know (I know) He's able.

CHORUS

When the earth all around is a-sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, When I need a friend,
When the earth all around is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, When I need a friend
I go to the Rock

I go to the.. I go to the Rock
I go to the Rock. I go to the Rock
I go to the Rock
