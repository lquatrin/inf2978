It's hard to imagine that
I've been there too
I've felt the passion burning in you
Every temptation, oh, I understand
Your savior knows what it is to be a man

CHORUS:
Promise me... promise me...
Before the passion turns to flame
Promise me you'll call my name
Promise me... promise me...
You'll remember these scars of grace
And remember I took your place
Promise me

I know what it's like when the
Nightmare comes true
Someone left a cross for me
Like they left for you
Trust me when I say... I've been
Where you are
The strength to live again my child is
Hidden in the scars

CHORUS

For those who stand, for those who fall
Strength is found in one place
Beneath my cross crying out for grace

CHORUS
