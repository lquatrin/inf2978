We can count the blessings that come to us each day 
But some remain invisible, and only seen by faith 
Still, they are so real though itís hard for human eyes, 
To see the riches of his Kingdom God is pouring in our lives 

CHORUS: 
In Christ, we have a life that never ends and a love that 
never dies 
In Christ, we have a hope that never leaves and a home in 
paradise 
Peace that passes understanding, joy this world cannot destroy 
There is forgiveness and purpose for each life, in Christ 

Once we were paupers but now we are the ones 
To share in Heavenís riches, we are joiners with Godís Son 
We have power through His Holy Spirit who instructs and 
intercedes 
We have wisdom for the asking, and strength for every need 

CHORUS 

In Christ...... In Christ.......
