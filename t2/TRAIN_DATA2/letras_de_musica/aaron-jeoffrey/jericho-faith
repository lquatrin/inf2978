All have walls to be torn apart 
Cold hard places rising up in the heart 
Standing in between what's holy and what's not 
We walk around deserts alone 
Chipping in vain at towering stones 
'Til we find they're impossible to break without God 

To be like Joshua 
Who trusted the Holy One 
A willing instrument 
Who let God get the job done 

CHORUS
It takes a Jericho faith 
Blind belief 
Following the voice when you cannot see 
Walking God's way 
Hearing His sound 
Jericho faith 
Makes the walls come down 

All have things to conquer down here 
But faith makes ruins out of pride and fear 
With the Father's hands we can level barriers 
He's crumbling before our eyes 
Smashing to pieces every wall inside 
We're living and learning to be stronger than we were 

No matter how great the size 
Of the stumbling block 
We gotta know that God 
Can make rubble out of rock
