I cover my heart 
Turn from the wind 
Button my coat 
Here comes the storm again 
What can I do but to trust in Him 

'Cause I know the deeper my faith runs 
The stronger I become 
And the thunder, it may shake me 
But I always know that¡¦ 

CHORUS: 
After the rain 
You can look to the sky again 
The clouds will give way 
To the light of the sun 
After the rain 
You know that you've made it through 
And you'll finally see the joy from the pain 
After the rain 

Everyone needs 
Everyone hurts 
Everyone feels 
The weight of the world sometimes 
But don't let the wind sweep your heart away 

'Cause even the roughest waters cleanse 
So when they come again 
Let them serve as a reminder 
You can always know that¡¦ 

CHORUS 

Can't you see the hand of Jesus 
Reaching out for you 
You never have to face the storm alone 

CHORUS
