Again the sky has fallen down on me
Once more a world has crumbled down and over me

And yet in some twisted way
I enjoy my misery
And in some strange way
I have grown together with my agony

I feel home in despair for i dwell in grief
And i feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
And i feel home anywhere human lives are going down the drain

For as long as i remember life has been hard
I guess they have "misery" written somewhere in my stars

For i have mourned for so damn longÂ…
That i've forgotten what it was for
Everything has gone so wrong
That i really couldn't think of anything more

I feel home in despair for i dwell in grief
And i feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
And i feel home anywhere human lives are flowing down the drain

I feel home in despair for i dwell in grief
And i feel home when the air's too thick to breathe
And i feel home anywhere the light of day is drowned in heavy rain

Yet i know the worst is still to come
