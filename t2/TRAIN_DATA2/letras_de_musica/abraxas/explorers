[Music: Mindner; Lyrics: MÃ¬ller]

[Verse 1:]
Ships cross the ocean shatter the time
'cause a new thinking arise that change our minds
leave all the certain behind

[Verse 2:]
Heroes are lonely new era begins
Reality is fading away whatever they do
Whatever they gonna do!

[Refrain:]
Many times in the history of the world
special kind of men are crossin' borderlines
There are signs everywhere in the universe 
and you need only one to pick them up

[Verse 3:]
Hallowed for conquest punished for crimes
Burned for the knowledge and truth
Believe and trust that's what a man keeps alive

[Verse 4:]
Questions need answers like the desert needs rain
Tomorrow's thinkin' and deeds are yesterdays dreams
Forever they gonna last

[Refrain:]
Many times in the history of the world
special kind of men are crossin' borderlines
There are signs everywhere in the universe
and you need only one to pick them up
