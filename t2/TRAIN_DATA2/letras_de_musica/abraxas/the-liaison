[Music: Mindner; Lyrics: MÃ¬ller]

[Intro:]
Sometimes at night I look up to the sky
a million stars fills the dark
Sometimes at night I look into the sky
I wish I'd be there!

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes at night when I'm closin' my eyes
some strange event passes by
Lightning's are crossing the sky
Is this a dream or reality?

[Verse 2:]
When do we learn to forgive our faults?
When do we start to live again?
Open your eyes and you will see 
that we can't turn our heads all the time!

[Refrain:]
Lights in the night are gonna fade away
Mankind sleep alone
Nobody has ever seen this before
We rise in the same time we fall

[Verse 3:]
Yesterdays people meet tomorrow's dreams
downtown when they are on "speed"
Future is risin' over the hills
We're not alone in this universe!

[Refrain:]
Lights in the night are gonna fade away
Mankind sleep alone
Nobody has ever seen this before
We rise in the same time we fall
