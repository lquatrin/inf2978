It has now spread itself all over inside me
All the way to the brain and down to my knees
My time comes closer with each day it lets me see
- with each night the pain keeps me from sleep

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
But those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes i will leave grieving and yet so relieved
With bitterness and joy

Pleasure and pain; heaven and hell - my memories
What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
But those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy

What a long and strange trip this has been for me
What a short and strange life this has been

It has given me much - maybe taken more
But those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time for goodbyes i will leave grieving and yet so relieved
With bitterness and joy

Life has given me much - maybe taken more
But those good times were always worth waiting for
When it's time to take leave of this world
I will leave with bitterness and joy
