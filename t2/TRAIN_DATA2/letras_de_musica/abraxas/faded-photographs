[Music: Mindner; Lyrics: MÃ¬ller]

Movin' slow blood runs cold promises ever behold
Targets there at last view
Start up the engine and be a hero today

Holy mission trapped in tradition a place in paradise
Honor of the family the final step into eternity

[Bridge:]
Time goes on for you and me
Vision or reality
Part of history no one know
Usual live goes on

[Refrain:]
Faded photographs 
Remains at all
Faded photographs

Mother cries lying pictures
Happiness calls from other times
Suicide is it right
Martyr dies in the name of God

[Bridge:]
Time goes on for you and me
Vision or reality
Part of history
Usual live goes on

[Refrain:]
Faded photographs
Remains at all
Faded photographs
