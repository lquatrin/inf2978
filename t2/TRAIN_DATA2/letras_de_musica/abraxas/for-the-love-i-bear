The silent peace this anguished morning brings leaves me to my grief
Oh, so many years i've been married to the grave
These bitter tears fill up my sorrowed eyes as i lay my head down
And beg myself to be so brave

Oh, how i miss your loving hate, and yet i miss her loving hate
Cursed be this love i bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air

The burning passion the glowing sunset gives will leave me to my joy
And i'll smile upon the stroke that murders me
So farewell my love, take all of myself and kill this love forsaken
And please send me no need of thee

Oh, how i miss your loving hate, and yet i miss her loving hate
Cursed be this love i bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air

Cursed be the love i bear
Bereaved be this heart that bleeds for her
The love of the man lives here
On grain and the earth, rain and the chilling air
