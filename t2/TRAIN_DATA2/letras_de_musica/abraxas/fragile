So many times i have brought you down
That i have already lost all count
And i seem to be doing it again
No matter how hard i have tried
I have crumbled time after time
And kept failing in the end

Sometimes it feels it would be better for you all
If i ceased to exist or was never born at all

So many times i have let you down
Shadowed the shine of our sun
And drowned you in tears and misery
That it is hard for me to see
How you can after all these years
Still be standing by me

Sometimes it feels it would be better for us all
If i ceased to exist or was never born at all
Sometimes it feels it would be easier to fall
Than to flutter in the air with these wings so weak and torn
