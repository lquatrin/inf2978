It feels that your love for me
Is slowly turning to dust
It seems that our union made of iron
Is starting to rust

I hate life
I hate this shit
I love you and i hate myself
I hate our world
And everything in it
I hate loving you
I hate
I hate

Give me a reason to live
One more day
Let me just once more feel
Your light through the rain

It feels that my love for you
Is eternal, never-ending
But it seems that you're not receiving
What i have been sending

I love life
I love this shit
I love you and i hate myself
I love our world
And everything in it
I love loving you
I love
I hate

Give me a reason to live
One more day
Let me just once more feel
Your light trough the rain

Give me a reason to live
One more day
Let me just once more feel
Your love through the pain
