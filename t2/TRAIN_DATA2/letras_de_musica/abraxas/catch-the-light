What happend about night's comming
Can't hear the monsters' crying
Can't see the light for reaching
Night doesn't come as night comes

I miss the sun while i seek the beam
I run to see it as it doesn't seem
Night doesn't come as night comes
Cause it goes to new you anymore
Old you turns to new you for more
To unlock the heavy closed door

To get the truth that can't be seen
Seek, run, catch. it will not come

Hear what i say
Seek run and catch
Try untill death
Catch the light
