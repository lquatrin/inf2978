[Music: Mindner, Klauke; Lyrics: Klauke]

[Verse 1:]
So many miles we walked away
so many times we had to pray
Every night we didn't sleep
every fight we didn't win
Every night we didn't laugh
in those dreadful times

[Bridge 1:]
Far far away out to the foreign land
so many miles from home
Fight kill and die here in the desert sands
oh Lord tell me why!

[Bridge 2:]
Silver and gold that's what we want
To get back the land that was the command
Honour and fame a crusaders aim
To win or to die that's a warriors fate!

[Refrain:]
Jerusalem aim of the pilgrim
Ancient city in the hallowed land
Jerusalem orient Lady full of mystic signs

Jerusalem aim of the pilgrim
Ancient city in the hallowed land
Jerusalem show me the mercy of your guardian hand!

[Bridge 3:]
Far far away out to the foreign land 
so many miles from home
Fight kill and die here in the desert sands
oh Lord tell me why!

[Bridge 4:]
Silver and gold that's what we want
To get back the land that was the command 
Honour and fame a crusaders aim
To win or to die that's a warriors fate!

[Refrain:]
Jerusalem aim of the pilgrim
Ancient city in the hallowed land
Jerusalem orient Lady full of mystic signs

Jerusalem aim of the pilgrim
Ancient city in the hallowed land
Jerusalem show me the mercy of your guardian hand!
