[Music: Mindner; Lyrics: Klauke]

Sometimes when I close my eyes I see faded days
A young man full of hopes and dreams a better life to live

[Bridge:] 
Time for me to go has come
I'm standing at the point of no return
There's no way out
I'm lost with every step I do

Then I got in touch with friends I never better known
Loosin' job and security a straight way into crime

[Bridge:] 
Time for me to go has come
I'm standing at the point of no return
There's no way out
I'm lost with every step I do

[Refrain:]
Into the light never come back
Revelations coming
Into the light one way ahead
Into the light

Now it seems to late for me a never needed junkies life
There's only one thing left to say
don't trust drugs and there false shine

[Bridge:]
Time for me to go has come
I'm standing at the point of no return
There's no way out
I'm lost with every step I do 

[Refrain:]
Into the light never come back
Revelations coming
Into the light one way ahead
Into the light
