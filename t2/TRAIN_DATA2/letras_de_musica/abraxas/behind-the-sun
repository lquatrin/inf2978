After the darkness of the night
Feel that i am loosing my might
Make me blind the brightness and the light
Can't see anything in that lack of dark

The truth is hidden in the shining light
Real life is behind the sun in the night

Words and faces are always fake
To be supposed they are really right
Eyes don't care eyes nothing in sight
After the night we're in the false fight

When the bold black night drops the streets
See everything dirty and ugly as it is
You have to have power to be free
You have to be real to stay here

The truth is hidden in the shining light
Real life is behind the sun in the night
