You parted me from my home
Gave comfort and false house
And beautiful clothes
As bourgeois bastards have

Tried to assimilate me
With your little bitches
You tried to brainwash
My brainÂ’s filled with your shits

When my soulÂ’s burning
By fire of revenge
On my own again
Hatred within my brain

Chorus
Back on the streets
Leave no retreats
Back on the streets
The home of the free
Back on the streets
Feeling deceits
Back on the streets
Feeling this heat

You worship to money
I worship to liberty
You are a fuckinÂ’ slave
I am the free stray

Tried to assimilate me
With your little bitches
You tried to brainwash
My brainÂ’s filled with your shits

Chorus

DonÂ’t try once again
Do not annoy to me
Or taste my rage
Like the fire of hell

Chorus
