Well, here i am, i'm back again
From the deadlands i descend
Back from the dead, back from the end
I'm here to take revenge!
Soon the deathly dusk will fall
And the night i've waited for
At the dawn you'll live no more
Breathing through death, living for bloodshed

I'm the suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away
I live to kill and kill to live
And long for dying endlessly
Each time i kill i'm born again
I have become the end
Thus i am and thus i'll die
Yet another thousand times
I am dead and i am alive

Take a deep breath
It's the last one you will get!

I'm the suicider dying every night and day
Killing me is not enough to make me go away
I'm the suicider seeking for the end of life
(but) killing me is not enough to cease the flame inside
Thus i kill and thus i'll die
Thus i will live for all time
