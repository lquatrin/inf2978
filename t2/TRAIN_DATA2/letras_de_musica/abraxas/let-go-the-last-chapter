Let Go (The Last Chapter)
Now everything
that used to matter to me
is taken away forever gone
The only things
I really have left here in this life
are bitter hate and this fucking gun
From this trip I'm taking now
I'm never coming back
It's time, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
This time I'll just let myself go
and leave this world behind
The booze flows in
like blood to heart that beats no more
and blows the flame of fear out
I raise the gun
my finger on the trigger
and put the barrel into my mouth
From this trip I'm taking now
I'm never coming back
It's time, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
This time I'll just let myself go
and leave this world behind
It's here, tonight's the night
the last one of my life
With no fear I'll just let my life go
and take the six-feet-dive
