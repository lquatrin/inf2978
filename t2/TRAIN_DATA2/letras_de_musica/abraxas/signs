[Music: Mindner; Lyrics: Klauke]

[Verse 1:]
Six o'clock radio tells the morning news
Same old stories same old lies again
TV preachers selling member cards
Heaven's for sale ten dollars cash

[Bridge 1:]
There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and anytime the rich will win

[Refrain:]
Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right

[Verse 2:]
Politician leaders give us promises
Idle words later on they can't remind
Doin' sales and deals behind a mask of truth
Bending the law in their own way

[Bridge 1:]
There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and anytime the rich will win

[Refrain:]
Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right

[Bridge 2:]
There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "Credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and everybody knows the rules

[Refrain:]
Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right
