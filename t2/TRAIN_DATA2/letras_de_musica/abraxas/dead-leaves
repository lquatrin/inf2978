Dead Leaves
Yes, Autumn's here again
to put all forms of life to an end
Death has taken over and slowly fades the light away
The deadly shadows fall
and the bleeding sun sinks down below
The first flakes of snow guide me on my last pathway
Alive no more what once was green has turned to red
Leaves start their fall gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
freezing all life that's on its way
The first dead leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain

I feel the flaming frost
I feel the burning ice and snow for the first time
since the night she was taken away
Alive no more what once was green has turned to red
Leaves lightly fall gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
ceasing all life that's on its way
Dead frozen leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain
hovering in the air

"and as the last leaf hovers down upon the ground,
the end is at hand - I'll find the one I came looking for"

Alive no more, what once was green has turned to red
Leaves lightly fall, gray with the whiteness of what's dead

The wintry frost comes crawling
freezing all life that's on its way
The last dead leaves come falling,
hovering in the air with the rain
The End of Life comes crawling
ceasing my bleeding heart and now
The last dead leaf comes falling,
hovering lightly down upon the ground
upon the frozen ground
