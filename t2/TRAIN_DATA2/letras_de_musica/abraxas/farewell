I've dragged myself through the blood and mud
And with burning eyes pushed the love away
No, i'm not the kind of man who'd play for keeps
The enchantment lies in the moment of goodbyes

For eternity
My sun has set down
I dream to flee
As i suffer "the black" bleed into me

I regret every single day i ever lived in my life
I gave all i had in me
So it's time to say goodbye
The breath of wind beneath my beating wings
Is slowly dying down
Yet raging it's final blow!

As it crumbles down' my castle in the air
The relieving words of farewell end my earthly hell

For eternity
My sun has set down
It has ceased to be
The lightning that once burned in me

I regret every single day i ever lived in my life
I gave all i had in me
So it's time to say goodbye
