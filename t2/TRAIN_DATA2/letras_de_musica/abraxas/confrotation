When the black robed
Real comes to you
His flashing eyes
Look into your eyes
WonÂ’t matter who you are
Brake your mask
By his strong claw
Like an eagle
YouÂ’ll become a little shit

When your blood frozes
DonÂ’t say Â‘mercy meÂ’
Does not remorse to you
YouÂ’ll pay for your doings
When that day comes
YouÂ’ll take your right
When that day comes
I will laugh at you

People live as their right
Key had been gived to you
But you sold that key
You had a chance to choose
Chose false one
When that day comes
YouÂ’ll take your right
And i will laugh at you

When the black robed
Real chokes you
DonÂ’t say Â‘mercy meÂ’
