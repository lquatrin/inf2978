I'm working on my forward thinking
Working on my self control
Process this ugly mess
And figure out how to make it whole

Choke down a bus ride to the city
Chase it with a trip to the East Side
It seems like over time
I'll get so numb that I won't mind

Some days I actually forget
That this is really something
One look from you and that is it
This is really something
Being hard is hard so sick of it
This is really something good
This is really something good now
