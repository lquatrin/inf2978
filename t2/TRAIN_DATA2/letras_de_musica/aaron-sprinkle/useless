I think you see me
The way that you'd like see
A man that gets nothing done

Ithink you'd like me to be
As useless as i seem
And leave everything undone

(chorus)
But the little boy I used to be
He had a conscience you could see
And he held it in his hand
He did not understand
That he would soon be me

I think you'd like to know
A place that I won't go
And spend some time

You say you need a friend
To take you by the hand
And sit awhile

(chorus)

If you could only feel this
It's nothing to believe
I ask an honest question
I get a silent scream

When I hear the answer
It's nothing I could see
If someone could have warned you
It takes much more than me

But the little boy I used to be
He had a conscience you could see
And he held it in his hand
He did not understand
That he would soon be free
