On a good day
You break my heart again
On the highway
You run me over when
You are leaving me and taking everything

Everyone sees
You at work
And they all think
I'm not worth
The trouble that you go through gets you nowhere

Like waking up before you land
I guess you figured we're no good
I guess I'll never understand

By the time you
Hear my crying
Will you feel like
Understanding
Plans to keep you by my side my darling

Is the gift of
True belief
Is so hard to believe
When all you seem to want to do is get away

Like pillows underneath a fall
It's not so bad to stick around
It doesn't have to hurt at all

Every folly, every quarter I have lost
Takes some adding and some blood to count the cost
But I've done all that I could

All the rainbows are black and white
And I'm colorblind
And I don't see nothing anymore
I don't see nothing anymore
And I don't know what I'll do without you
