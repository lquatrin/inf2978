All this ringing in my ears
Made me numb over the years
Lately I can feel a little more of You in me

I've given up unto myself
Drinking from the weakest well
All I want is just some peace of mind
Tonight
But i'm fine without it

I'm beginning now to understand that its Nothing i can say
When motor cars with racing stripes keep Getting in my way

But this time I can see
The very one thing that I need

I'm beginning now to understand that its
Nothing I can say
When motor cars with racing stripes keep
Getting in my way
But this time I can see the very one thing
This time you could be the very one thing
This time I believe the very one thing that I need
