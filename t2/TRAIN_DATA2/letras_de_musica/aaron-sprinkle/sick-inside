I only spoke to you that way
To get it through your haggard brain
That I could be so much more
I could be someone that someone would adore

(chorus)
Seems like a long time since I felt good
Good enough to not want to cry
Do you know better now?
Well so do I

The hardest thing is knowing when
I should draw the line and not give in
To all of your tired ways
It's like i've got a second job that never pays

(chorus)

I feel so sick inside I know it's wrong
But I just can't bite my lip and go along
(repeat)
