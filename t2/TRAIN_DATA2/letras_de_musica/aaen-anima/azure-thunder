Mystery Â– wrought ritual
Everybody´s ´round the fire
Their cops are red
And talk about me
 
Dark powers appear
New Era begins
They´re changing the future
They are coming to the daemons of the rivers
I feel torture
I feel torture
 
Is it my body
Or is it my soul
I´m inside the circle
I observe deafly
 
Dark thunder..
To the ships..
Through fire..
Dark thunder !!!!!
 
Dark thunder through the ships to the fire
