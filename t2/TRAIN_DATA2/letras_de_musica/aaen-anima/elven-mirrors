Elven mirror.. 

Gothic has fallen in our thoughts 
And fire´s scattering our hearts 
We´re looking for the paradise 
Paradise in remnent of disguise 

Silently.....Rotting irony 

Did we have third eyes 
Or is it just a dream 
Living inside our lies 
It´s possible to scream 

We have lost the paradise 
With tears / elven eyes 
Strange hearts and unclean spirits 
And eyes lost in our lies 

Meet me in your dreams, please 
You know, that I´m your tears 
With devil on our lips 
We live in bloody years 

Try to be succesful 
Lead the way 
Become the beast 
And do what I say 

Gothic has fallen in our thoughts 
And fire´s scattering our hearts 
We ´re looking for the paradise 
Paradise in remnent of disguise 

Silently.....rotting irony
