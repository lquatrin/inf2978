The old realm beyond the Sea
Curse..
Sleep
Curse..
 
The prince with the blue horse is coming
He´s that man who will break the curse
By one kiss
The ancient pulse..
 
The curse came back with the morning stars
 
All -the -world -will -sleep -and -no -thing -will -take -it -back
The hands of sand clock can´t submerge
 
There´s coming nameless
They sleep in roses
 
Dreams of their sleep fade away
Her black cope
Dreams..
Her black..
 
Through electrons that are alone in my body
Through fields of the sky
I´m endless forever
Like my blackened side
