When everything came crashing down the emptiness tore me up from the inside out the silence broke me down to nothing through the ashes of this year I saw you buried and laid to rest It was so hard to hold back all my tears I never thought I'd see the day that I would have to mourn a fallen friend so I stand in disbelief,
Unwilling to accept I try to understand how a world consumed by darkness it's a tragedy that it lost one of it's brightest lights in a time when things fall apart so quick I still hold on to the pieces and keep you alive This requiem is all I haveto show that you are in my heart to show that you are still with me in a time when things fall apart so quick and mourning became a constant it's up to me to make sure that you arent' forgotten from this day forward I will not relive the days of grieving release your ghost and let it finally rest your imprint still stays with me I held on to your words they were a guide when the storm was right on top of me the days behind me are broken your spirit still lives on inside through it all I will remember I will remember you I will carry on for you
