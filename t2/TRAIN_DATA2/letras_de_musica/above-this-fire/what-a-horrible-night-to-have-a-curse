As we hang here by a thread and as the morning light pours in I can only hope for a chance to repay everything through the hardest times to date it's so rare to find one thing that will see me through from the darkest hell to the brightest heavens say what you will my hope has been restored say what you will I have redemption in my grasp say what you will I know that I can still move on say what you will but this stays with me for a lifetime When I've come down to the end of my rope and I cant see the end it's good to know that I can count on you for all the times that I have almost faded away you could have easily turned and left mark my words I will be standing by your side why would you follow me to the point of no return I guess that's what I get for putting my faith in you I get friendships that last as long as time allows for 
now there is a reason to hold on
