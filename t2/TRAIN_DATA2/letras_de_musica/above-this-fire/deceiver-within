I am nothing more than a ghost in your eyes and when I spoke of potential those were the last words I wish I could stop from choking an for once let the truth show I have counted the days while you counted all my faults I want to let me honesty set me free from these shackles Ive watched my leaders go from allies to enemies from the point of loyalty to the point of breaking I'll never understand why I'll never understand how keep up your front but all the while you shake me to splinters hours stolen from me I now see the deceiver within so now I keep my head through a heavy heart as of right now this place is a graveyard I'll pass through the misery I'll keep on despite the stares from vultures I will rip out the claws from my own back if this is what I have to do,
So be it in the end,
it's all about standing up for myself seperate me in the form of flying setting myself aside making promises that will remain my foundation for hereafter what lies in front of me will tell me of my fate the hour is nearing I cant deny my heart I wont fail today the endless moments of what will become of me I've known it would all come down In this moment right here but will it take a lifetime to find out if my choice is right I will not turn back,
There will be no regret
