Your empty threats fell on my deaf ears long distance lies from the tongue of someone else I showed you that I can shed these scars I'll keep my head above the rising water and I'll stand tall through days and the nights I won't let these demons lead me down the path of deception it's only words from the mouths of the weak I'll set the example,
I'll set myself apart (from you) so how does it feel?
To know that I have overcome how does it feel?
To know that I picked myself back up how far?
How far has this gone?
I'm in the shadow of something that's trying to bury me alive it seems to be all so crystal clear to everyone around me while I remain here in the dark the truth shall light my way I know at this point,
I know it's up to me to either let the undertow pull me down or cut myself free,
And fight my way out this will stop,
This will end today and it will all come back on you it's up to me
