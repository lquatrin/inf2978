I breathe again the fire within me will prove you wrong you buried me alive and left me with nothingthe venom from your tongue will not infect me and I breathe again so when the ink dries when the sun sets with all I have I'll carry on resurrection taking place shadows fading fast with absence of tears and the faith that I have in myself I will drown everything you said to me overcome the very lies that spit from your mouth I have withstood the storm that you created so while you stay heartless I burn the day lights out let the rain fall let the bridges burn after you gave up on me and everything I put my all into fell apart and slipped through my hands like sand this is the last time that I'm writing you burning the day lights out and I can see through that this won't last forever so while you stay heartless 
I burn the day lights out
