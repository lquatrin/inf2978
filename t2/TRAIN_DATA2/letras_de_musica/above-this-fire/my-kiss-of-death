Wrap your wings around me angel I'm at a loss for words but your voice could stop my blood flow and I'm sorry for everything will your eyes pierce my skin will you see what's inside of me or the hell I've put myself through when I've bled myself dry of everything from my past let me take one last deep breath let the sunset end today please stay with me until I pass out it's my kiss of death fall into your open arms just whisper make this your 
first embrace to make me forget
