They say that music calms the savage beast
And helps a heartache settle down
ThatÂ’s what I need tonight to sooth me
And dull her memory when it comes around

Tipjars and teardrops
Sad songs for lonely hearts
A temporary cure for the blues I got
I get loose when I hear guitars but then the music stops
And all thatÂ’s left is tipjars and teardrops

She used to fill my heart with melody
LovinÂ’ words IÂ’d never heard before
Now without her IÂ’m in quiet misery
And I canÂ’t take this silence anymore

I get loose when I hear guitars but then the music stops
And all thatÂ’s left is tipjars and teardrops
