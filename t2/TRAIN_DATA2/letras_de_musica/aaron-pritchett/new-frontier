Wake up baby it's time to leave
We got plans and we got dreams
We got a long way to go
Pack up all of your emotions
All your faith and devotion
We're gonna need it this I know
If you're at the edge of the past
Our future's unfolding fast, baby don't look back

We're going to a new frontier
Wide open without fear I'll walk this winding road
With you into the great unknown
We're going to a new frontier
Let's trust that love will lead us
Right where we belong, and walk on 

Verse 2:
I can't wait to get out of here
The wind is up and the path is clear
For the first time in my life
Our destination don't concern me
More and more I'm learning
It's the journey, it's the ride
Everything is within' our grasp
When we have the courage to ask, and we don't look back

CHORUS 

Solo:

I know there's no confusion
Where my heart is movin'
I know it's true, I know it's true

Chorus: (key change)
We're going to a new frontier
Wide open without fear I'll walk this winding road
With you into the great unknown
We're going to a new frontier
Let's trust that love will lead us
Right where we belong, and walk on
