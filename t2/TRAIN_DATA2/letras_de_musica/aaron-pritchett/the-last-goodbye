Sprintime in Savannah
It donÂ’t get much prettier than this
But it feels like itÂ’s wintertime to me

The sky is clear and the sun is bright
I ainÂ’t looking forward to the night
Cuz a cold chill is all IÂ’m gonna feel

IÂ’m so sorry, I know the fault is mine
I guess thereÂ’s nothing left to try
As you pack your bags I cannot deny
This is the last goodbye

We always managed to get through tough times
Without getting burned
I took you for granted and said youÂ’d never leave
Now the tables have turned

IÂ’m so sorry, I know the fault is mine
I guess thereÂ’s nothing left to try
As you walk away I cannot deny
This is the last goodbye

I never told you that I loved you
There was so much time
But now itÂ’s too lateÂ… much too late

IÂ’m so sorry, I know the fault is mine
I guess thereÂ’s nothing left to try
As you close the door and I begin to cry
This is the last
This is the last
This is the last goodbye
