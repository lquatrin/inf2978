Well, I changed my ways to please that woman
But that could never be good enough
I gave up drinkin and I took up churchinÂ’
For a while it wasnÂ’t tough
But barkeep IÂ’ve made a decision
After doing the best I could
That for better or worse
IÂ’m gonna be bad for good

So, bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for talking
Worn every woman around
IÂ’m gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
And for better or worse
IÂ’m gonna be bad for good

I really like my reputation
And how IÂ’m known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
IÂ’m gonna be a tough act to follow
DoinÂ’ what I said I would
And for better or worse
IÂ’m gonna be bad for good

IÂ’m gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
And for better or worse
IÂ’m gonna be bad for good
Yeah, for better or worse
IÂ’m gonna be bad for good
