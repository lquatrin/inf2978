Verse 1:
Up in the mornin'
It's off to work I go
And drivin' along
I got a feelin' for the country
Deep in my soul
I wasn't made for the big town
I need boots spurs and jeans
Outside these city limits
Where the air's cool and clean

And I'm a city cowboy
Longin for the saddle and the pull of the rains
A city cowboy
Tryin' to shake these city chains
And all my life
I've been dancin to the rhythem of a different song
Tryin to get a long way out of town
I'm a city cowboy 
V2:
And high rise buildings
Workin' all day long
I got a feelin I've been
Doin everything all wrong
I need a southern sweetheart
And a place to call my own
Workin' the range from 5 to 9
And my fingers to the bone

And I'm a city cowboy
Ridin' along across the plains
A city cowboy
Tryin' to break these city chains
Ridin' hard
I'm lookin' for that song that's in my soul
And it sure ain't Rock N' Roll
I'm a city cowboy 
Bridge: 
I won't let this feeling die
forever yearning for that open sky

And I'm a city cowboy
Longin for the saddle and the pull of the rains
A city cowboy
Tryin' to shake these city chains
And all my life
I've been dancin to the rhythem of a different song
Tryin to get a long way out of town
I'm a city cowboy
Up in the mornin'
It's off to work I go
