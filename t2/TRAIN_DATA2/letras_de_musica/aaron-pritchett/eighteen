ThatÂ’s a death-deying walk sheÂ’s got
Dancing to the parking lotÂ… oooo 18

What she does to t-shirts
Sure do make my eyes hurtÂ… ooo, 18

Somebody ought to write a song about ut so I did
Makes me wish I was a kid againÂ… 18

We were made out of asbestos
Dairy Queen for breakfast at 18Â… 18

Rock and roll was king
and cars were everything at 18Â… 18
Nobody could have told us anything and if they tried
It gave us something to fight about at 18

Blue jeans, young hearts knockin out big dreams
You and me work werÂ’re burning like gasoline
ItÂ’s amazing that we ever lived pastÂ… 18

Shooting city limit signs
Chasing girls and wasting timeÂ… ooo, 18
Pretending we were tough
Telling stories that we made upÂ… ooo, 18
Dressing like the pictures hanging in our bedroom
We tore out of a magazineÂ… at 18

Cruisin in convertables, completely indestructible
We were hookin up and hangin out
Believing what we sang aboutÂ… 18
Kroeger on a Friday night, making circles out of headlights
Yeah it felt so good being aliveÂ… 18
