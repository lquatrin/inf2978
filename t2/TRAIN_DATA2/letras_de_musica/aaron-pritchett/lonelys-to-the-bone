I took her keys she took a cab
She made sure the front door slammed
Between the rain and the whiskey,
the whole thing's still a blur
She caught a plane to San Antone
i got that far then the trail went cold
Since then i haven't heard a
single word from her
Now i found out that

All i've lost is all i want
An all i'll ever need
And i realize the deepest cut
can take a while to bleed
Cause suddenly it hit me she
left me all alone
And leavin's only skin deep
but lonley's to the bone

The phone'll ring once or twice
I'tll be some number I don't recognize
But nobody's ever home when I call it back
The door's unlocked the coffee's on
The fire's burnin' but she still ain't home
Don't know if i'll ever learn to live with that
I found out that

All i've lost is all i want
An all i'll ever need
And i realize the deepest cut
can take a while to bleed
Cause suddenly it hit me she
left me all alone
And leavin's only skin deep
but lonley's to the bone

yea it would me so easy if
your memory'd just move on
But leavin's only skin deep
and lonley's to the bone
