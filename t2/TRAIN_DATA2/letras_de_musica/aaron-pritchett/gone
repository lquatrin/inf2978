I guess i didn't see
How much she meant to me
I let opportunity pass me by

Been sitting firmly on the fence
When i came to my sense
and let her know how I feel inside
Well, I guess i took too long...

Cuz she's gone
Love has a way of moving on

Everyday and everynight
I'm living the words i write
And I've been singing a lot
of heartbreak songs

She couldn't stand the wait
Now it's too little too late
My hindsight shows me i was wrong
Well, you don't know what you got

Till it's gone, gone
Love has a way of moving on
Yeah, she's gone, gone
Love has a way of moving on

Well, you don't know
what you've got
Yeah, you don't know
what you've got

Till it's gone, gone
Love has a way of moving on
Yeah, she's gone, gone
Love has a way of moving on
Oh. my baby's gone
