I was thinking Â‘bout the perfect words
To say to that living doll
By the time that I had worked it out
She was half way down the hall

My schoolboy fears of being shot down
Kept that dream from getting off the ground
Lookin back I figured out I thought about it too long

Sometimes you just gotta jump in, get yourself movinÂ’
Countdown the clock is runnin
Sometimes thereÂ’s no time to doubt it, just gotta do it
DonÂ’t even think about it

So, baby if it seems IÂ’m coming on too strong
ItÂ’s just that I donÂ’t want to feel this feeling gone
Cuz in this moment there could be a golden opportunity
To tell you what you mean to me
DonÂ’t want to think about it too long
