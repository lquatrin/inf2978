Go tell the sheriff John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now he's living at the foot of the cross 
He testified on the main drag this evening 
Said he?s gonna spread the gospel to the lost 

The meanest sinner to ever live and breath 
Said he's been clean and sober for a week 
He said his soul was not troubled anymore 
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the lord 

Go tell the sheriff John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
In a tent revival outside of town 
Oh what a friend this town has in Jesus 
If you look at what John Roland had torn down 

Before the spirit touched his soul 
He left the street sides full of bulletholes 
Back then when he was raising hell 
He knew it was coming the blue lights on his tail 
Look out now 

Go tell the sheriff John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now that water tower must be full of wine 
Let not your weary heart be troubled 
Turn your women and your Children back outside 

What will we do on Friday night 
Without John Roland shooting out the light 
Carry that old Jukebox away 
He traded mean guy for amazing grace 

Go tell the sheriff John Roland Wood's found Jesus 
Now he's living at the foot of the cross
