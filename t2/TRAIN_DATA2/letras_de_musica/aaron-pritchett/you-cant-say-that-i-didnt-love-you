Well that's how it is when it's over and done
All bets are off and we both go runnin' for cover
Blamin' eachother
Yeah the grapevine will hum with the fiction or fact
Gets kinda messy in the aftermath of a meltdown
It's always a small, small town

Chorus
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that i didn't love you
Does it make me a jerk 'cause it just didn't work
When you can't say that i didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can put a new face on that old twist of fate
But deep down inside you can't say that i didn't love you

Now it's only normal to criticize
How it all went down 'cause the tension's running high
And we say things, that we don't mean
But that doesn't change last summer and fall
If that wasn't love then what do you call, september
Do you remember?

Chorus:2
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that i didn't love you
You can vilify me to a certain degree
But you can't say that i didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can tailor the truth till it fits like a suit
But deep down inside you can't say that i didn't love you

There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one

Chorus:3
You can doctor the spin when you tell all your friends
But you can't say that i didn't love you
Does it make me a jerk cause it just didn't work
When you can't say that i didn't love you
You can vilify me to a certain degree
But you can't say that i didn't love you
There were some things we could not overcome
But love or the lack of it never was one
You can put a new face on that old twist of fate
But deep down inside you can't say that i didn't love you
