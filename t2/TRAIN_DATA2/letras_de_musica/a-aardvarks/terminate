Forming fantasies of hate 
with pure demise 
cause in her eyes 
there's no disguise 
an open gate 
Although the mirror bears the sign 
truth passes by 
unseen for days 
the victim prays 

Kept inside for all those years 
the strangled dreams she dreamt 
the unflown tears 
suppressing fears 
bringing death to mortal life 
the soul to please 
to reach release 

Stabbing knife and smashing head 
boiling face and eyes of dead 
while the blood is running red 

Breeding thoughts and stunning greed 
licking wounds until they bleed 
all those needs to feed 

Life is hasting towards death 
all that is left 
is just a bitter taste of all the waste 
You can't change the speed of time 
You cannot change the speed of time 

Stabbing knife and smashing head 
boiling face and eyes of dead 
while the blood is running red 

Breeding thoughts and stunning greed 
licking wounds until they bleed 
all those needs to feed
