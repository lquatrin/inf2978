Staring into my eyes
finding the difference deep in me
try to erect my spine
by selling my personality

Harming the ones I love
sharing the hate that s shaking me
trying to stop my fall
Fragments of warmth are leaving me

Building a wall of lies
creating a mask of confidence
filling the cracks that show
with the solitary of my existance

I cannot explain
what s forming my disdain
I cannot feel redemption
Hate without restraint
Burry my complaint
with the rapture of pretention

Willing to change my mind
feeling the distance inside of me
proving the force of thought
selling the fear that s left to be

Building a wall of lies
creating a mask of confidence
filling the cracks that show
with the solitary of my existance

I cannot explain
what s forming my disdain
I cannnot feel redemption
Hate without restraint
Burry my complaint
with the rapture intention
