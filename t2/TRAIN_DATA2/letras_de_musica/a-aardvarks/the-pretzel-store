So I went down to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about those crazy shapes
Twisty, curvy, holey, and straight
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into birds
And flew away
Everyday
They flew away
Oh, those tricky pretzels

So I went back to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about that yummy flavory
Salty, sweet, and a little bit savory
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into rainbow fish
And swam away
Everyday
They swam away
Oh, those tricky pretzels

So I went back to the pretzel store
'Cause I wanted to buy one or two more
Let me tell you all about those favorite toppings
Chocolate dipped and honey whipped
But I don't want to eat pretzels today
'Cause these tricky pretzels turned into horses
And galloped away
Everyday
They galloped away
Oh, those tricky pretzels
"Neigh!"

So I went back to the pretzel store
'Cause I love pretzels
I love pretzels (Hey, come back here, pretzels!)
I love pretzels (Where are you going, pretzels?)
I love pretzels (Oh, well, I guess I'll eat some chips.)
I love pretzels
