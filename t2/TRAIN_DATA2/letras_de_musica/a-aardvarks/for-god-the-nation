Under the flag of honour 
marching towards the front 
for god and the nation 
facing the battlestorm 
young men join the colours 
heroic deeds in mind 
the idea to kill the enemy 
drives them really mad 

For God and the Nation win the day 
Don't surrender til the battle is won 
but they're falling one by one 

Roaring guns and aircraft 
Destruction still remains 
Horrors of trenchwarfare 
Shattering their brains 
Stumbling over corpses 
How long will you survive? 
You came to fight for glory 
Now you're left to die 

For God and the Nation win the day ...
