Now once I stood like a mountain high
Cold and rough and no sign of life
Didn't need no one didn't want no love
Yeah, but that was before I felt her touch

CHORUS
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
she did all alone
She polished up the good
And she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone

With a willing heart and patient hands
She poured her love on a hopeless man
Oh, the doubters laughed they couldn't see
And now they stare in disbelieve

She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
she did all alone
She polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone

Now I ain't perfect by any means
But I suit her and that suits me
Hey, I'm a miracle of a woman's love
And I'll be her rock till I turn to dust

She made a man out of a mountain of stone
What the whole world couldn't change
she did all alone
she polished up the good
And then she chipped away the wrong
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
She made a man out of a mountain of stone
