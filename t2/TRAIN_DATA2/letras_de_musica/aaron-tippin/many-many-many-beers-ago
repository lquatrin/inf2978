With Every Drink I Take, It's Gettin' Harder to Recall
And I Ain't Gonna Stop Until I Forget It All
'cause Once Upon a Time She Used to Love Me So
But That Was Many, Many, Many Beers Ago
All My Tin Can Buddies That Help Me Ease the Pain
One By One They Remind Me She's Not Coming Back Again
Just How Long She's Been Gone I Can't Say I Really Know
Lord, It's Been Many, Many, Many Beers Ago

I Don't Need a Watch Or a Clock On the Wall
To Tell Me Just How Long It Took For Me to Lose It All
And This Gettin' Over Her Is Going Pretty Slow
It's Been Many, Many, Many Beers Ago

Yeah, All My Tin Can Buddies That Help Me Ease the Pain
One By One They Remind Me She's Not Coming Back Again
Just How Long She's Been Gone I Can't Say I Really Know
But It's Been Many, Many, Many Beers Ago

Yes, It's Been Many, Many, Many Beers Ago
