If You're Lost and You're Alone
Let Me Sing You a Song
Oh, You're Not the Only Lonely One Tonight
I Know What You're Goin' Through
I Can Sympathize With You
I've Been Wakin' in Your Shoes All My Life
I Was Born With a Broken Heart
Born to Lose Right From the Start
Raised On Hand-me-down Blues
That's Why I Sing the Way I Do
A Sad Six String and a Jukebox Voice
I'm the Lonely People's Choice
I Was Made to Play the Part
I Was Born With a Broken Heart

If the Sun Should Ever Shine in Your Life
Well, Friend, That's Fine
And May You Leave Behind These Old Troubled Times That We've Shared
Oh, But Don't Look Back For Me
I'm Where I'm Supposed to Be
And Anywhere There's a Lonely Street I'll Be There

I Was Born With a Broken Heart
Born to Lose Right From the Start
Raised On Hand-me-down Blues
That's Why I Sing the Way I Do
A Sad Six String and a Jukebox Voice
I'm the Lonely People's Choice
I Was Made to Play the Part
I Was Born With a Broken Heart

Yes, I Was Made to Play the Part
I Was Born With a Broken Heart
