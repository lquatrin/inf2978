It Ain't Nothin' But a Small Frame House On An Acre Lot
It Ain't That Much Diff'rent From Any Other House On the Block
And It May Not Look Like We Got All Our Share of the Promise
But At Least One Thing's For Sure, I Got It Honest

Roll Out of the Sack Every Mornin', Head On Down to the Mill
Give 'em All I Got For Eight, 'cause That's the Deal
If You'll Check Out My Paycheck
Well, You'll See That There Ain't That Much On It
But Ev'ry Single Penny I'm Paid, I Got It Honest

I Never Had to Hang My Head in Shame
For Puttin' a Price Tag On My Name
Never Turned My Back On What I Believe
Or Let My Heart Be Ruled By Greed
'cause Buddy If I Didn't Earn It, I Don't Want It
That Way I Can Always Say, I Got It Honest

Now You Ain't Looking At Some Dude
That Was Born With a Silver Spoon in His Mouth
And I Might Seem Like Some Kind of Low-life
To That High-falutin' Crowd
But I'm Plain Spoken, Straight Talkin'
And Damn Proud of What I Have Acomplished
Some Folks Appreciate That and Some Don't
But, I Got It Honest

Now When I Die, I May Not Leave My Kids a Fortune
But I Hope They Know'd My Life Stood For Things That Were Important
And I'll Hand Out the Same Sturdy Old Values of My Daddy and My Momma
It Made Me Every Ounce of What I Am and I Got It Honest

I Never Had to Hang My Head in Shame
For Puttin' a Price Tag On My Name
Never Turned My Back On What I Believe
Or Let My Heart Be Ruled By Greed
'cause Brother If I Didn't Earn It, I Don't Want It
That Way I Can Always Say, I Got It Honest
Friend There Ain't no Doubt About It, I Got It Honest
