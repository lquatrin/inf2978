She burns too hot, plays too rough.
She's got a dress full of dangerous stuff.
The way she looks tears me apart,
But the way she loves me nearly stops my heart.

If her lovin' don't kill me,
Don't put me six feet down,
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill.
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will.

My doctor told me I looked kinda ragged,
He said: "What happened, boy? Did you fall off the wagon?"
I said: "It ain't my drinkin' or my smokin' doc.
"It's my drop dead darlin' rockin' me around the clock."

If her lovin' don't kill me,
Don't put me six feet down,
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill.
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will.

Instrumental break.

Ev'ry night, she tears me up.
She gives it good and I can't get enough.

And if her lovin' don't kill me,
Don't put me six feet down,
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill.
If her lovin' don't kill me then nothing will.

If her lovin' don't kill me,
Don't put me six feet down,
I'll be the last man standin' on the top of the hill.
If her lovin' don't kill me,
Then I swear nothin' ever will.

Nothin', nothin' will.
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
I'm invincible.
(If her lovin' don't kill me.) 
If her lovin' don't kill me. 
(If her lovin' don't kill me.) 
(If her lovin' don't kill me.) 
(If her lovin' don't kill me.) 
(If her lovin' don't kill me.)
