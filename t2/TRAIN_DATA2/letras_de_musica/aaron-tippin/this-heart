God Gave Me the Will to Survive, a Good Strong Back and a Mind
And All the Tough Stuff It Takes to Fill a Man's Shoes
Then God Put This Heart in Me For You
It Pushes the Blood Through My Veins
To Swing This Nine Pound Hammer One More Day
But There's Only One Reason Why It Beats So True
God Put This Heart in Me For You
This Heart Really Don't Belong to Me
This Heart Will Be Yours Eternally
The Man Upstairs Put It There 'cause
He Knows What to Do

I'd Be Nothin' But Flesh, Blood and Bones
If I Had to Walk Through This World Alone
Just a Ramblin' Fool, a Blind, Stubborn Brute
Without This Heart in Me For You

This Heart Really Don't Belong to Me
This Heart Will Be Yours Eternally
The Man Upstairs Put It There 'cause
He Knows What to Do

God Put This in My For You
Yes, God Put This Heart in Me For You
