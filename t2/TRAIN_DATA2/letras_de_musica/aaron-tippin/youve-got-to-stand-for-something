Now Daddy Didn't Like Trouble, But If It Came Along 
Everyone That Knew Him Knew Which Side That He'd Be On 
He Never Was a Hero, Or This County's Shinin' Light 
But You Could Always Find Him Standing Up 
For What He Thought Was Right

He'd Say You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything 
You've Got to Be Your Own Man Not a Puppet On a String 
Never Compromise What's Right and Uphold Your Family Name 
You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything

Now We Might Have Been Better Off Or Owned a Bigger House 
If Daddy Had Done More Givin' in Or a Little More Backing Down 
But We Always Had Plenty Just Living His Advice 
Whatever You do Today You'll Have to Sleep With Tonight

He'd Say You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything 
You've Got to Be Your Own Man Not a Puppet On a String 
Never Compromise What's Right and Uphold Your Family Name 
You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything

Now I Know That Things Are Different Than They Were in Daddy's Days 
But I Still Believe What Makes a Man Really Hasn't Changed

You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything 
You've Got to Be Your Own Man Not a Puppet On a String 
Never Compromise What's Right and Uphold Your Family Name 
You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything

You've Got to Stand For Something Or You'll Fall For Anything
