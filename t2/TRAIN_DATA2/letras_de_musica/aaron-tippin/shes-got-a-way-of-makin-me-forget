She Said When She Found Me I Was Barely Hanging On
To the Memory of a Love That Had Been Long Gone
There Must Have Been Somebody Else I Don't Remember Who It Is
'cause She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

When She Takes Me in Her Arms I Get Lost in Time
She Takes Complete Control of My Heart and My Mind
I'm Not Haunted By the Past Old Memories Or Regrets
Oh She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

She's Taught Me That Tomorrow Is a Reason to Live
Don't Blame and Accuse Just Love and Forgive
Now Every Grudge I Ever Had no Longer Exists
'cause She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

When She Takes Me in Her Arms I Get Lost in Time
She Takes Complete Control of My Heart and My Mind
I'm Not Haunted By the Past Old Memories Or Regrets
Oh She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

Oh She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

She Said When She Found Me I Was Barely Hanging On
To the Memory of a Love That Had Been Long Gone
There Must Have Been Somebody Else I Don't Remember Who It Is
'cause She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget

Oh She's Got a Way of Makin' Me Forget
