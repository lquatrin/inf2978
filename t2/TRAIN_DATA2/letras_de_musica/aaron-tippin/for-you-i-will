It's Not My Style to Dance Away the Night
Or Go For a Walk Beneath the Full Moonlight
And I Don't Wish On Falling Stars
Or Easily Give Away My Heart

But Girl, For You I Will
Can't Hide This Love That I Feel
Never Been the Kind of Guy
To Fall in Head Over Heels
But Girl, For You I Will

It's Not Like Me At All to Talk About
The Likelihood of Finally Settling Down
Couldn't Speak the Words "i Love You"
Or Find the Courage to Say "i Do"

But Girl, For You I Will
Can't Hide This Love That I Feel
Never Been the Kind of Guy
To Fall in Head Over Heels
But Girl, For You I Will

I've Never Been the Kind of Guy
To Fall in Head Over Heels
But Girl, For You I Will
