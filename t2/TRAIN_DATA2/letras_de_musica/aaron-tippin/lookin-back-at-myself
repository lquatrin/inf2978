I Put Down My Razor
Toweled Off My Face
Thought I Saw a New Wrinkle
And Another Strand of Gray
That One Little Scar
Kept Catching My Eye
Reminding Me How Time Does Fly
I Was Only a Kid
When I Had That First Fight
But I Still DonÂ’t Give In
When I Believe That IÂ’m Right
And At Least I Can Stand Here
And Like What I See
In the Man That Kid Turned Out to Be

Lookin?back At Myself
ItÂ’s Plain to See
That the Cold Hands of Time
AinÂ’t Had Much Mercy On Me
But I Played a Straight Game
With the Cards That Were Dealt
And I Can Look Straight Ahead
Lookin?back At Myself

Now I AinÂ’t Been no Angel
But I Learned Right From Wrong
Thanks to Mamma and a Hickory
And a Love So Strong
Yes She Taught the Rule
That Life Is Lived By
I AinÂ’t Forgot What You Get
For Getting?out of Line
Now This Old World Throws Some Punches
And IÂ’ve Taken a Few
Now My SkinÂ’s Tough As Leather
But IÂ’ve Grown Strong With the Truth
ThereÂ’s Been So Many Times I CouldÂ’ve Just Stepped Aside
Ah But Then I CouldnÂ’t Stand Here With This Peace of Mind

Lookin?back At Myself
ItÂ’s Plain to See
That the Cold Hands of Time
AinÂ’t Had Much Mercy On Me
But I Played a Straight Game
With the Cards That Were Dealt
And I Can Look Straight Ahead
Lookin?back At Myself

Still Look Straight Ahead
Lookin?back At Myself
