If somebody would've told me
One woman could hold me
And leave me weak as a baby
I'd have told'em they were crazy
CHORUS
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing

I used to play it so cool
Lord knows that I was no fool
No chains would ever bind me
But those days are all behind me-
you see
(repeat chorus)

I never saw love's power
Just the hearts and the flowers
When I fell it was frightning
It struk me down like lightning-
when
(repeat chorus)

I used to live like a rolling stone
Nobody had a hold on me
All it took was a kiss from you
To bring me right to my knees
(repeat chorus)

Yeah, that's all she wrote
