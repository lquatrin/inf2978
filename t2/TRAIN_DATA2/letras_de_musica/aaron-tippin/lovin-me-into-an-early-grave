Always Wanted One to Put Me to the Test
A Hot Blooded Woman That Could Love a Man to Death
I Got What I Wanted But Lord I Gotta Say
She's Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
I Get Up in the Morning I'm Headed For the Door
The Last Kiss Leads to a Thousand More
I'm Late For Work But I Can't Get Away
She's Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave

Finally Found a Reason to Live
But Lord She's Gonna Kill Me As Good As She Is
But If You've Gotta Go Well It's the Only Way
She's Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave

Now I Wouldn't Trade Places With Any Man Alive
But Man Alive It's Hard to Survive
But I'm Gonna Keep Trying Till My Dying Day
She's Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave

Finally Found a Reason to Live
But Lord She's Gonna Kill Me As Good As She Is
But If You've Gotta Go Well It's the Only Way
She's Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave

Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
Lovin' Me Into An Early Grave
