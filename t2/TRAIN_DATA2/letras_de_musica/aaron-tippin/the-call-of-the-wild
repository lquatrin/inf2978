She's Been Staring Out the Window Four Nights in a Row
Like a Caged Up Tiger, She's Pacing the Floor
And She Just Can't Resist When She Feels the Pull
She's Got a Restless Spirit That She Can't Control
And When She Gets Like This, I Gotta Let Her Go

She Hears the Call of the Wild Every Once in a While
She Lets Down Her Hair, She's Gotta Get Somewhere
She Can Turn It Loose and Howl
I Know What's in Store, Katie Bar the Door
When She Winks At Me and Smiles
She's in a Foot Stompin,' Honky-tonkin'
Love Making State of Mind
So Excuse Me, Y'all, I Gotta Answer the Call of the Wild

If There's Ever Been a Lady, Well, Baby Is
Just More of a Woman At Times Like This
Now, Don't You Worry About Baby Stepping Out of Line
Yeah, She Drives Me Crazy, But It Suits Me Fine
She's Hard to Handle, So I Hold On Tight
And Lord Knows I Got My Hands Full Tonight

She Hears the Call of the Wild Every Once in a While
She Lets Down Her Hair, She's Gotta Get Somewhere
She Can Turn It Loose and Howl
I Know What's in Store, Katie Bar the Door
When She Winks At Me and Smiles
She's in a Foot Stompin,' Honky-tonkin'
Love Making State of Mind
So Excuse Me, Y'all, I Gotta Answer the Call of the Wild

I Said Pardon Me, Y'all, I Gotta Answer the Call of the Wild
