Just a Skinny Little Mississippi Railroad Man
That Loved to Sing and Play
He Brought His Music From the Cotton Fields
To the The Hillbilly Hall of Fame
Thank God For Jimmie Rodgers
Chisel His Name in the Cornerstone
I Just Wish He Could've Lived to See the Day
When Country Took the Throne
Now a Million Songs Have Come and Gone
Since We Made That Humble Start
About Neon Nights, Everyday Life
Love and Broken Hearts
And More and More Folks
Kept Tuning in and Turning On
Now I Can Proudly Say That I Saw the Day
When Country Took the Throne

Now From Carolina to California, Texas to New York
They Can't Get Enough of This Country Stuff
And They're Screaming For More
We Painted the Town With That Grand Old Sound
And the Whole World Sang Along
Yes, I Was There the Day
When Country Took the Throne

Now, no One Knows What the Future Holds
But I Bet My Best Guitar
There'll Be a Jukebox Jumping On Jupiter
And a Honky-tonk On Mars
In the Last Frontier They'll Stand and Cheer
The Best Music Ever Known
They'll Celebrate That Age Old Day
When Country Took the Throne

Now From Carolina to California, Texas to New York
They Can't Get Enough of This Country Stuff
And They're Screaming For More
We Painted the Town With That Grand Old Sound
And the Whole World Sang Along
Yes, I Was There the Day
When Country Took the Throne

I Said I Was There the Day
When Country Took the Throne
