You Reach Out and Touch Me and Tell Me You Love Me
And Promise That You Always Will
But As I Start to Kiss Your Tender Lips
I Wake Up to My Living Hell
These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me
Your Heavenly Memory Is Pure Misery
I'm Losing My Mind One Night As a Time
These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me

When Sleep Comes I Hold You Just Like I Used To
In a World Where Our Love Still Lives
But Each Mornin' I Wake As I Feel My Heart Break
When I Lose You All Over Again

These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me
Your Heavenly Memory Is Pure Misery
I'm Losing My Mind One Night As a Time
These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me

These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me
These Sweet Dreams Are Killin' Me
