Jack handed Rita his paycheck
With his apologies
he said they're cutting back at work
They had to let me go
And Jack expected tears
he expected worse
But he didn't expect these words
As Rita pulled him close
And she said to him -- don't worry about it baby Let me tell you something

At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love,
who loves you
And who's your friends
'Cause God don't care where you live Who you are, what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day

Now betty handed bob the keys
To their million-dollar home
She said -- Bob this might be living
But it sure ain't love
I thought I had to have all this
I thought it made me "Me"
Ah, but now I think that it's just
twenty cold rooms full of stuff
And she said -- let me tell you something
Else, Bob

At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love,
who loves you
And who's your friends
'Cause God don't care where you live Who you are, what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day

Now when my grandpa died
He didn't have a dime
But he was rich, they say
And when it came time to see him off
The whole damn county came
And I remember he used to say it all the time

At the end of the day
Is really where it all begins
With who you love, who loves you And who's your friends
'Cause God don't care where you live Who you are, what you drive or how much you make
All that really counts is how you sleep
At the end of the day

At the end of the day
