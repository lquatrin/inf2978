I made five hundred miles in six hours flat tryin' to make up for lost time
I been beatin' a path to your mama's door to set things between us right
Between the hands of fate and a lot of hard luck this ain't been no gravy train
And I didn't come this far just to walk away

I slung a rod just east of Memphis and that heap of a truck shut down
So for nine cold hours I thumbed my way straight to the guitar town
And the last twelve miles to your mama's house I hiked through the pouring rain
And I didn't come this far just to walk away

I could have turned around a thousand times and went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles if I could save what's left of us
It was a burning love that drove me here and girl I hope and pray
That I didn't come this far just to walk away

I know that this front door ain't the only thing that stands between you and me
All the things that I've said and the wrong that I've done ain't undone easily
But I'm gonna prove my love to you no matter what it takes
Cause I didn't come this far just to walk away

Oh I could have turned around a thousand times...
Oh I didn't come this far just to walk away
