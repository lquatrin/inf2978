Well, I've done it every way they say it oughta be done,
But if I can't be me, well, it ain't much fun
So I bowed out; said: "I gotta go"
"Gotta crank it on up, I got to free my soul"
So it's back to my roots an' startin' today,
I'm a-ready rock in a country kinda way

Ready to rock (All night long)
Yeah, ready to rock (Till the cows come home)
Well, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid:
I'm just a-ready to rock in a country kinda way

This time I got a guitar that you gotta plug in,
An' a stack of screamin' amps twisted way past ten
I'm havin' a ball an' to tell you the truth,
I'm back to makin' music like I always do
I got Conway an' Jones flowin' through my veins,
An' I'm ready rock in a country kinda way

Ready to rock (All night long)
Yeah, ready to rock (Till the cows come home)
Well, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid:
I'm just a-ready to rock in a country kinda way

(All right boys, c'mon let's play a little)

(Ah, do it again, go on do it again)

Hey, I don't think ol' Hank'd mind if I done it this way:
Ready to rock in a country kinda way

Ready to rock (All night long)
Yeah, I'm a-ready to rock (Till the cows come home)
Hey, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid:
I'm just a-ready to rock;
Yeah, I'm ready to rock;
I'm ready to rock, rock, rock, rock in a country kinda way

(Now, ain't that pretty?)
