As We Passed in the Hall
She Said We Need to Talk
I Can't Go On Like This Another Day
I Froze in My Tracks
And a Chill Ran Up My Back
'cause I Knew What She Was Gonna Say

She Said There's Someone Else
And I've Kept It to Myself
But I Can't Keep These Feelings Locked Inside
I Need to Tell You This
It's One of Your Old Friends
One You Haven't Talked to in a While

She Said I'm Leaving
And There's Nothing You Can Do
I Said I Had a Feeling You Found Somebody New
And I'll Bet I Can Guess His Name
But It's So Hard to Believe
'cause She Said You're Not Even Close
It's Someone You Don't Know
I'm Leaving You For Me

I Just Stood There At a Loss For Words
Tryin' to Catch My Breath
'cause I Knew That It Was Over When

She Said I'm Leaving
And There's Nothing You Can Do
I Said I Had a Feeling That You Found Somebody New
And I'll Bet I Can Guess His Name
But It's So Hard to Believe
Oh She Said You're Not Even Close
It's Someone You Don't Know
I'm Leaving You For Me

She Said You're Not Even Close
It's Someone You Don't Know
I'm Leaving You For Me.
