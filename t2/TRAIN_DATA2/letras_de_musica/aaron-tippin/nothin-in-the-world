Well, I've Moaned the Blues Since She Slammed That Door
Drank and Cried and I Walked the Floor
And Her Memory's Backed Me Against the Wall
So Tonight I'm Gonna End It All
You Can Say Goodbye to This Lonely Guy
Nothin' in the World Can Save Me But a Girl

Help Me, Help Me, I'm About to Die
There's a Lovesick Man On the Prowl Tonight
Don't Call the Doctor, Don't Call the Law
When a Good Lovin' Woman Can Fix It All
I Gotta Have Another She to Rescue Me
Nothin' in the World Can Save Me But a Girl

Well, I Know Y'all Think That I've Gone Mad
I'm Out Huntin' Me One Like I Just Had
It's Like Grabbin' a Hold of a High Line Wire
Or Jumpin' Out of the Pan Straight Into the Fire
Oh, But Only a Man Can Understand
Nothin' in the World Can Save Me But a Girl

Help Me, Help Me, I'm About to Die
There's a Lovesick Man On the Prowl Tonight
Don't Call the Doctor, Don't Call the Law
When a Good Lovin' Woman Can Fix It All
I Gotta Have Another She to Rescue Me
Nothin' in the World Can Save Me But a Girl
