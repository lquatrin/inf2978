Maybe We'll Never Be Seen Together 
At Night On a Crowded Street 
I May Never Reach Across Your Body 
And Kill the Light When You're Asleep

Maybe I'll Never Watch You Dressing 
Or Sound Too Familiar On the Phone 
But I Can Touch Your Hand That's Against Me 
And Take That Moment Home

That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You 
Even Though There's Nothing Else I'd Rather do 
I Can Dream, I Can Hope, I Can Scheme But Still I Know 
That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You

I Won't Be There When You Need Holding 
But I'm Sure That He Can Pull You Through 
But I Can Sing This Song to Everybody 
And Pretend It's Not About You

That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You 
Even Though There's Nothing Else I'd Rather do 
I Can Dream, I Can Hope, I Can Scheme But Still I Know 
That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You

That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You 
Even Though There's Nothing Else I'd Rather do 
I Can Dream, I Can Hope, I Can Scheme But Still I Know 
That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You

That's As Close As I'll Get to 
Yeah That's As Close As I'll Get to 
That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You
