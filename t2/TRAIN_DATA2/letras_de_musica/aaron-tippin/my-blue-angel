Somewhere Out There in the Smoky Air
Where the Night Is Neon Blue
Surrounded By Strangers, She Don't Know the Dangers
One Drink Could Lead Her To
And If She Falls, It's All My Fault
For Doin' a Good Woman Wrong
I Can't Be Far Behind Her
Oh, Lord, Help Me Find Her
Before My Angel Is Gone
Looking For My Blue Angel
The Same One That Flew From My Arms Last Night
If You See My Blue Angel
Tell Her That Heaven Without Her Feels Like Hell Tonight

Last Night When She Left I Told Myself
That She Wouldn't Go Too Far
Now I'm Not So Sure How Long Her Tears
Could Last in a Stranger's Arms
She's Wounded I Know and Feeling So Low
She Could Fall At Anytime
I Don't Know What I'd Do If I Were to Lose
That Precious Angel of Mine

Looking For My Blue Angel
The Same One That Flew From My Arms Last Night
If You See My Blue Angel
Tell Her That Heaven Without Her Feels Like Hell Tonight

Yes, Tell Her Heaven Without Her Feels Like Hell Tonight
