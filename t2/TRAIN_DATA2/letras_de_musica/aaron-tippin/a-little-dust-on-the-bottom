Cleo williams lived down the dirt road.
Made homemade wine like nobody i know
I dropped by one friday night, and said, can you help me cleo
I got a little girl waiting on me, and i want to treat her right

He said i got what you need son its set down in the cellar
He reached through the cob webs as he turned on the lights

Chorus
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool ya about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that get sweeter with time

You were sitting in the porch swing as i pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed in side
You slide over a bit closer as we rode down to the lake road
Watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached down in the front seat and
Said now heres something special
Its just been a waitin' for a night like tonight
But

Chorus
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool ya about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that get sweeter with time

You're still with me we made some memories
After all these years theres one thing i found
Some say good love well its like a fine wine
It keeps getting better as the days go by
But

Chorus (2x)
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But dont let it fool ya about whats inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But its one of those things that get sweeter with time

Dont let it fool ya.
