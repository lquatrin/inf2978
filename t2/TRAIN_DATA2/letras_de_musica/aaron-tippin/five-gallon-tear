We were all drinking at marge's one
night
When an old cowboy came through the
door
He took a few shaky steps
Then he started to moan
And he keeled over right on the floor
Doc came on over, took his stethoscope
out
He listened and he looked in his eyes
He said, "Boys stick around
I just might need your help
I'm afraid this will be a long night"

CHORUS
Cause there's a five gallon tear, a five- gallon tear
Lodged in this poor boy's heart
By the look in his eyes he ain't cried in
years
And he's reatining a five gallon tear

Doc wrote a prescription to induce him
to cry
It was whiskey and sad country songs
We propped him up in a booth
And poured a drink down his throat
Then we turned that old wurlitzer on
Well he spluttered and he coughed
And he hung down his head
As those lonely songs worked on his
heart
When the memories started coming six
minutes apart
We laid him face-up on the bar

SECOND CHORUS
And then a five gallon tear, a five gallon
tear
Slowly welled up in his eyes
We all yelled, "Push!" and we all gave a
cheer
When he cried that five gallon tear

BRIDGE
That jar by the door don't hold pig feet
no more
The contents are sparkling clear
That liquid within is not moonshine or
gin
It's a reminder to everyone here

THIRD CHORUS
Yeah, it's a five gallon tear, a five gallon
tear
Let this be a lesson to you
Keep your sorrow inside for too many
years
And you'll cry that five gallon tear

Buddy you'll cry
You'll cry a five gallon tear

Reprise: REPEAT THIRD CHORUS

FADE
