You say you finally found your Mr. Right
He's got you flying like a dime store kite
Well I'll be waiting here on the ground
Look me up if he lets you down

CHORUS
You've always got me to fall back on
A rabbit in your hat, an ace in the hole
It might help to know you've got a Plan B
Whatever else happens you've always got me

I gave you my heart and my heart is true
I won't take it back no matter whay you do
You're gonna have to carry it permanently
No matter who else loves you,
you've always got me

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Another iron in the fire,
another horse in the barn
Another map to your treasure
An extra safety net -- another hedge on your bet
A little bit for good measure

(REPEAT CHORUS)

It might help you to know you've got a Plan B
Whatever else happens you've always got me
