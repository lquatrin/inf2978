What Makes Me Get Up Every Mornin'
When I Can't Find the Will
And What Keeps Me Goin' Through the Motions
When All My Dreams Are Standing Still
Why Do I Try So Hard
How Did I Get This Far
What Is the Bottom Line Each and Every Time

I Do It For Her
It's All About Her
God Knows She Gives Me More Than I Deserve
Every Thought I Think
Every Breath I Breathe
Everything That I Hold Dear to Me
Revolves Around One Simple Little Word
Her

There's Times I Take It All For Granted
Just How Fortunate I Am
God Knows It Took a Better Woman, to Make Me a Better Man
Oh, Sometimes It Don't Show
Don't Always Let Her Know
What I Couldn't Live Without
I Know There Ain't a Doubt

I Do It For Her
It's All About Her
God Knows She Gives Me More Than I Deserve
Every Thought I Think
Every Breath I Breathe
Everything That I Hold Dear to Me
Revolves Around One Simple Little Word
Her

She's My Life's Work
And For All That It's Worth

I Do It For Her
It's All About Her
Oh God Knows She Gives Me More Than I Deserve
Every Thought I Think
Every Breath I Breathe
Everything That I Hold Dear to Me
Revolves Around One Simple Little Word
Her

Talkin' About Her.
