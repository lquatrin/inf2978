Well, I've Been Waiting For Just the Right 
Moment 
To Tell You What's On My Mind 
I Don't Know Exactly How to Say It 
But I do Think That It's About Time 
I do Know That You've Been Working All Day 
And I Know That You Could Use the Rest 
But I've Got a Little Proposition For You Baby 
No Tell Me What You Think About This

Chorus

Let's do the Night Shift Baby 
I Mean All Night Long 
Do What Comes Naturally 
'til the Bread of Dawn 
We'll Toss and Turn and Roll and Shout 
And Love Every Minute We Can 
Let's do the Night Shift Baby/mama 
(Yeah) I'm Ready to Dance

Hey, Let's Go Down to Coyote's Lounge 
I Hear They Got a Pretty Good Band 
Yeah, We'll Take It Somewhere Where the 
Lights Are Low 
If We Still Ain't Ready to Quit 
Who Knows We Might Even Give a Brand New 
Meaning 
To Doing the Night Shift

Repeat Chorus Twice

Let's do the Night Shift, Honey 
Well, I'm Ready to Dance
