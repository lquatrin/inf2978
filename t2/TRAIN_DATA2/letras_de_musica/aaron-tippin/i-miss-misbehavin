I Used to Smoke and Stay Out Late
Sometimes I Drank More That I Ate
I Used to Think, Man, I Was Bad
Why, I'd Fight At the Drop of a Hat
I Took a Walk On the Wild Side
I Guess I'm Lucky That I Survived
I Had Some Days I Can't Forget
And Sometimes At Night I Think About 'em Yet
I Miss Misbehavin'
Yeah, I Miss Misbehavin'
I've Settled Down Now
But Sometimes I Miss Misbehavin'

There Was a Girl I Do Recall
She Was As Tough As She Was Tall
We Used to Dance to Every Song
Lord, We Held Each Other All Night Long
She Used to Call Me Her Honey Baby
I Called Her My Miss Misbehavin'
I Wonder If She's Still Around
And If She's Out There Misbehavin' Now

I Miss Misbehavin'
Yeah, I Miss Misbehavin'
I've Settled Down Now
But Sometimes I Miss Misbehavin'

Yeah, I've Settled Down Now
But Sometimes I Miss Misbehavin'
