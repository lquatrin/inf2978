Girl I know that I promised you
I could make your every dream come true
But I admit I've got a little ways to go
Trust me baby we're closin' in quick
Before you know it we'll be stckin' the bricks
So stick like glue we got nothin' to lose

And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started
Don't quit now we got our foot in the door
Say you're not about to end the party
Baby hang on tight just a little bit more

I stand behind every word I say I love you baby
There's your reason to stay
Don't be flip floppin' when you know that we're rockin' along
I can't believe you want to throw in the towel
Stop and think of what I'm talking about
You threw your hat in the ring so go and get that thing

And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started...

Like an old violin or vintage wine all good things come in good time
We might run out of road but it ain't the end of the line
Honey I swear up and down our turn's about to come around
We'll have it all in the long haul

And baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started...

Oh baby don't stop we're just a gettin' started...
