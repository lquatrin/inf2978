I've always lived on the edge of life
I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you

I've looked danger in the eye
I'm not afraid to live or die
But after all that I've been through
I'd be afraid of losing you

I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
To keep me satisfied

I've always been a restless soul
Hungered for the winding road
But a rebel heart still knows the truth
I'd be afraid of losing you
... ...
I couldn't face a single day
Without you in my life
Your sweet embrace is all it takes
To keep me satisfied

I've always lived on the edge of life
I don't fear the dark of night
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
I'd be afraid of losing you

I'd be afraid of losing you
I may be crazy but I'm not a fool
Yes I'd be afraid of losing you
