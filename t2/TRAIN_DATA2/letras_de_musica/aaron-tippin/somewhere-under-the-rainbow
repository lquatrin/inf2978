This street that we live on 
Aint no yellow brick road
And this pay check, that i bring home 
Sure aint no pot of gold 
When people dream they don't wish they were up 
They don't know we got more then enough
Somewhere under the rainbow 
Watchin the late show and livin on love
Dancin slow to the radio, just holdin on 
Somewhere under the rainbow 
Some folks spend there whole life, dreamin about the other side 
Well there aint never far, that old blue birds fly 
But i'll take forever, were the skys aren't always blue 
when i'm in your arms, I know dreams come true 
Somewhere under the rainbow, watchin the late show 
Livin on love, and dancin slow to the radio
Just holdin on, somewhere under the rainbow 
Somewhere under the rainbow, yes watchin the late show 
And livin on love, and dancin slow to the radio
Yeah holden on, somewhere under the rainbow
