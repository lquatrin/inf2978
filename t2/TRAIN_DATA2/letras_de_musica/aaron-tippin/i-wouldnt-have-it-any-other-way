I've Walked the Straight and Narrow and I've Worn a Rebel's Brand 
Sometimes I've Had to Go Without For Bein' My Own Man 
I've Rallied to the Cause When I Knew the Cause Was Right 
I've Cut Against the Grain, But I've Kept My Peace of Mind 
And I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 
If There's a Price For Bein' Me, That's One I'll Have to Pay 
I'll Take the Good and Bear the Bad Until My Dyin' Day 
I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 
Oh, I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 

I Could Have Taken a Beaten Path Every Time Trouble Starts 
I'd Rather Take a Beatin' Than to Ever Cross My Heart 
Stickin' to My Guns, Can't Be Sold Or Bought 
Holdin' to My Honor no Matter What the Cost 

And I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 
If There's a Price For Bein' Me, That's One I'll Have to Pay 
I'll Take the Good and Bear the Bad Until My Dyin' Day 
I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 
Oh, I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way 

I Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way
