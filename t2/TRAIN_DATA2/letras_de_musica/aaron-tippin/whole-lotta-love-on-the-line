I've Called From Every Run Down Phone Booth in Atlanta, Georgia
Tryin' to Find Someone to Tell Me Where You'd Gone
I Begged and Pleaded With Your Mama 'til She Gave Me This Number
Honey, We Can Work It Out
Just Come Back Home

'cause There's a Whole Lotta Love On the Line
And All I Need Is a Chance to Change Your Mind
Don't Hang Up the Phone, 'cause Everything's Not Gone
Think About It, Baby
There's a Whole Lotta Love On the Line

All This Distance That's Come Between Us Has Gone Far Enough
And Now I Know That Closer to You Is Where I Belong
And That Feelin' I'm Feelin' Inside Is What I'm Tryin' to Send Through These Wires
Oh, Darling Who Cares
Who's Right Or Who's Wrong

'cause There's a Whole Lotta Love On the Line
And All I Need Is a Chance to Change Your Mind
Don't Hang Up the Phone, 'cause Everything's Not Gone
Think About It, Baby
There's a Whole Lotta Love On the Line
