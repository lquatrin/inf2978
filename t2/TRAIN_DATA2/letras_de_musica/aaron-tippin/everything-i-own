I can't shower you with pearls and diamond rings
All I can give are dances in the rain
I can't cover you in satin sheets
But you'll be just as warm 
Wrapped up each night inside my loving arms

I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own

I can't promise you, the life that money buys
I can promise you a richer life
There's places you may never see
But one thing you can know
I'll be there with you, wherever we don't go

I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own

All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
Oh you can have everything I own
