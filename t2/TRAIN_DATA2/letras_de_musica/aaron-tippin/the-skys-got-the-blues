Way Up in the Sky, Not a Cloud Is Flyin' By
A Picture Perfect Afternoon
Birds Upon the Wing, I Can Hear Them Sing
Chirping Out a Happy Tune
And I'm Walkin' Around With My Head Hanging Down
Got a Reason For Feeling This Way
Since You've Been Gone Things Look So Wrong
The Sky's Got the Blues Today
The Sky's Got the Blues, Just Like I've Got Them For You
That Old Sky's Got the Blues and I've Got Nothing to Look Up To
Yeah, the Sky's Got the Blues, the Sky's Got the Blues Today

Everyone I See, Happy As Can Be
Loving All This Warm Sunshine
So Many Things to Do, Beneath a Sky of Blue
Not a Worry On Their Minds
Oh But I Could Stand a Change, Some Clouds Or Some Rain
Now Ain't That Sad to Say, But It Could Take a Turn
As Far As I'm Concerned, the Sky's Got the Blues Today

The Sky's Got the Blues, Just Like I've Got Them For You
That Old Sky's Got the Blues and I've Got Nothing to Look Up To
Yeah, the Sky's Got the Blues, the Sky's Got the Blues Today

Yeah, the Sky's Got the Blues Today
