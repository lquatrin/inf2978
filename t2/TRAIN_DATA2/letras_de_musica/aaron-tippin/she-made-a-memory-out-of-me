You're Looking At a Man That's Almost Gone
Had a Good Woman and I Went and Did Her Wrong
Honey Found Out I Was Lovin' Double Time
She Moved Me From Her Heart to the Back of Her Mind
She Made a Memory Out of Me
Just a Vision of the Past Is All You See
Like a Statue of Stone a Part of History
Yeah, That Woman Made a Memory Out of Me

Lord, I'm So Low Down For What I've Done
I Don't Even Make a Shadow When I'm Walking in the Sun
I Hide My Face, Hang My Chin
Just Another Sad Story 'bout An Old Has Been

She Made a Memory Out of Me
Just a Vision of the Past Is All You See
Like a Statue of Stone a Part of History
Yeah, That Woman Made a Memory Out of Me

Say Lord, That Baby Made a Memory Out of Me
Just a Vision of the Past Is All You See
Like a Statue of Stone a Part of History
Yeah, That Woman Made a Memory Out of Me

Lord, That Baby Made a Memory Out of Me
