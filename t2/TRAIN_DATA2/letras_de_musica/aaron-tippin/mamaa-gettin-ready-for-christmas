Yeah, we all know it's comin'
Every year, Thanksgivin' day
We're gonna wish we hadn't
But we all come over anyway
And it's nice to see the family
And lord, her cookin's great
But when she starts a'hummin' on Jingle Bells
We know there ain't no escape

'Cause Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
And you better stay out of her way
She's got a a million lights, a ton of decorations
And they gotta go up today
Yeah, there ain't no doubt when they're all pulled out
She's gonna have a job for you
Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
So you better get ready too

Now she's the queen of redneck Christmas
At least that's what my daddy thinks
While he's climbin' up the ladder with an eight foot Santa
That laughs and waves and blinks
Last year my brother Bill almost got killed
Wirin' up that artificial tree
And when I get done with these stupid plastic reindeer
That's the last that woman's gonna see of me
I bet you that!

Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
And you better stay out of her way
She's got a a million lights, a ton of decorations
And they gotta go up today
Naw, there ain't no doubt when they're all pulled out
She's gonna have a job for you
Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
So you better get ready too

Aw, the front yard's gonna look like Las Vegas
And folks will come from near and far
'Cause everybody knows when she throws that switch
Christmas is about to start

Yeah, Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
And you better stay out of her way
She's got a a million lights, a ton of decorations
And they gotta go up today
Naw, there ain't no doubt when they're all pulled out
She's gonna have a job for you
Yeah, Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
So you better get ready too

I said my mama's gettin' ready for Christmas

Merry Christmas everybody!

So you better get ready too
