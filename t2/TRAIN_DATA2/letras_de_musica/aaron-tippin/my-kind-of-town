This Is My Kind of Town
I Ain't Never Seen Nothin' Like It
In All My Traveling 'round
If This Old Highway Ever Gives Me Up
And I Think About Settling Down
Well, This Is My Kind of Town

There Ain't no Place On God's Green Earth
I'd Rather Be Right Now
Folks Around Here Sure Seem to Know
What Living's All About
I Could Hang Around Here Forever
Lord, I Feel So Much At Home
When It Comes Time For Me to Leave
It'll Be So Hard to Go 'cause

This Is My Kind of Town
I Ain't Never Seen Nothin' Like It
In All My Traveling 'round
If This Old Highway Ever Gives Me Up
And I Think About Settling Down
Well, This Is My Kind of Town

Now, I Ain't the Kind to Just Muscle In
On Someone Else's World
But From What I've Seen It Seems to Me
They Got Lots of Extra Girls
And If I Could Find Me One of Them
And a Little House Nearby
Well, I'd Park These Boots, Hang This Hat
And Stay Here 'til I Die 'cause

This Is My Kind of Town
I Ain't Never Seen Nothin' Like It
In All My Traveling 'round
If This Old Highway Ever Gives Me Up
And I Think About Settling Down
Well, This Is My Kind of Town

If This Old Highway Ever Gives Me Up
And I Think About Settling Down
