I look at you and I remember
The way I felt on the day we met
That same feeling washes over me, its hard to forget
Nothin has ever changed to maybe
Nothin changes for you
I still want you just as much as I did
When I said I do

CHORUS:
Im still wrapped up in that ring around your finger
Without you baby I would be lost
Im tellin you the truth
Im still in love with you as I always was

Im a slave to your every desire
I worship the ground where you walk
Im tellin you the truth
Im still as much in love with you as I always was

You stir up that old desire
I can feel it now as we speak
Nothin I ever felt before prepared me for a love this deep
Yeah Im still crazy you baby
In my heart and in my soul(heart and soul)
Im still mezmorized by two brown eyes and a band of gold

Repeat Chorus

Oh im tellin you the truth 
Im still in love with you as I always was
