When I Look Back On This Life and All the Things That I Have Done
Lord, I've Paid Some Pretty Prices For Never Backing Up
But Now That I've Had Time Alone and I've Been Through Every Page
There's Only One Part of My Story That I Wish That I Could Change
If I Had It to Do Over and I Knew Then What I Know Now
I'd Do Anything I Had To, to Keep You From Walkin' Out
Your Love Would Be the Only Reason For Anything That I'd Undo
Yes, If I Had It to Do Over, I'd Do It Over You

There Are Bridges I Have Burned and There Are Promises I've Made
And the Ones That I Have Broken I'll Have to Carry to My Grave
And When I Stand Before the Throne and Answer For My Every Deed
The Only One That I'll Regret Is What I've Done to You and Me

If I Had It to Do Over and I Knew Then What I Know Now
I'd Do Anything I Had To, to Keep You From Walkin' Out
Your Love Would Be the Only Reason For Anything That I'd Undo
Yes, If I Had It to Do Over, I'd Do It Over You

Yes, If I Had It to Do Over, I'd Do It Over You
