If you got a problem, donÂ’t care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you of this, I can help 
I got two strong arms, I can help
It would shore do me good to do you good, let me help

ItÂ’s a fact that people get lonely; ainÂ’t nothing new
But a woman like you baby should never have the blues
Let me help; take a tip from me, I can help
It would shore do me good to do you good, let me help

When I go to sleep at night youÂ’re always a part of my dreams
HoldinÂ’ me tight and tellinÂ’ me everything I wanna hear

So donÂ’t forget me baby; all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you; if I can do anything at all, let me help
If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would shore do me good to do you good, let me help

When I go to sleep at night youÂ’re always a part of my dreams
YouÂ’re holdinÂ’ me tight and tellinÂ’ me everything I wanna hear

So donÂ’t forget me baby; all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you; if I can do anything at all let me help
If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would shore do me good to do you good, let me help

It would shore do me good to do you good, I can help
