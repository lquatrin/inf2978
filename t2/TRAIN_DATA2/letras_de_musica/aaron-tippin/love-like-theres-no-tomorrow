Right Now Gonna Take You in My Arms 
Hold You Closer and Tighter Than I Ever Have 
I'm Gonna Say All the Things That I Thought Could Wait 
Now I Realize That Later Could Be a Little Too Late 

Baby Let's Love Like There's no Tommorrow 
Live For Every Moment 
Laugh Atleast Alittle Everyday 
If We See the Sun Rise in the Morning 
Is Impossible to Say 
So Let's Love Like There's no Tommorrow 
Today 

From Now On On Every Time We Kiss 
It's Gonna Mean 
So Much More When I Touch Your Lips 

When I Give Myself to You 
Baby I Won't Hold Nothin' Back 
Cause There's Nothin' I Wouldn't Give 
To Make Every Minute Last 

Baby Let's Love Like There's no Tommorrow 
Live For Every Moment 
Laugh Atleast Alittle Everyday 
If We See the Sun Rise in the Morning 
Is Impossible to Say 
So Let's Love Like There's no Tommorrow 
Today
