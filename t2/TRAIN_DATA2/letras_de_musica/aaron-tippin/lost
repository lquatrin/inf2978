A couple of bucks worthof change in the ashtray
A half a tank of Texaco
You're sitting with your feet on the dash fiddling with the radio
Take a left at the edge of town, out where the roads ain't paved
And if we never find our way back, it doesn't matter anyway


Chorus
('Cause/But') I've been lost since you found me
Head over heart and soul
As long as your arms are around me
It don't matter where we go
I'm right where I always dreamed that I would be
Lost since you found me


We can go to the Oklahoma
Take a swim if it gets too hot
Or have an ice cold Coca-Cola at the Whistle Stop
I never noticed that little white house with a for sale sign
And i've been up and down this road about a million times


REPEAT CHORUS


BRIDGE
Ever since you came in sight
I don't know my left from right
Where i start or where you end
Baby, all I know is


REPEAT CHORUS


Since you found me
Lost since you found me
I've been lost since you found me
Oooo, since you found me
Lost, lost, lost, lost since you found me

(FADE)
