Of all the things I've ever done I'd be hard pressed to think of one
That makes me feel the way you do nothing compares to loving you

Of all the things I've yet to try there ain't one thing that comes to mind
My running wild days are through nothing compares to loving you

I don't need a mountain I don't need the chanlenge
I don't need a river to cross
Girl I can't imagine what could be worth havin'
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you

And one day when I face the Lord heaven won't be my reward
Until you're up there with me too nothing compares to loving you

I don't need a mountain...
Nothing compares to loving you

There ain't nothin' I could ever dream of
That I want more than your sweet love
[ guitar ]
Hey I don't need a mountain...
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you hey yeah yeah
