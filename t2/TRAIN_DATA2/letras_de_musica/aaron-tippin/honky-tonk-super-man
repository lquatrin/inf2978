Well, Down At the Factory, I'm Never Late 
I'm a Mild Mannered Man Who Pulls His Weight 
I Give a Hundred Percent, I Don't Ever Stop 
'til Friday Evening When I Punch That Clock 
Then I Disappear Until the Weekend's Through 
And You'll Never Guess Who I Turn Into 

I'm a Honky-tonk Superman 
Ready Or Not, I'm Back Again 
Dancing On the Tables 
And Swinging From the Chandeliers 
I'm a Honky-tonk Superman 
That's Who I Really Am 
A Real Rebel, Dare-devil 
Honky-tonkin' Superman 

Everybody's Waiting For My Next Move 
Last Night I Broke the Record For Acting a Fool 
My Favorite Waitress Said I Went a Little Too Far 
When I Came Roller Skating Down the Top of the Bar 
Now, Don't Blame Me For Just Having Fun 
The Never Should Have Bet Me That It Couldn't Be Done 
('cause) 

I'm a Honky-tonk Superman 
Ready Or Not, I'm Back Again 
Dancing On the Tables 
And Swinging From the Chandeliers 
I'm a Honky-tonk Superman 
That's Who I Really Am 
A Real Rebel, Dare-devil 
Honky-tonkin' Superman 

Hey, Look Up There On the Neon Sign 
It's a Bird, It's a Plane, Lord, He's Lost His Mind 

Oh, It's Just Honky-tonk Superman 
Ready Or Not, I'm Back Again 
Dancing On the Tables 
And Swinging From the Chandeliers 
Whoa, Yeah, I'm a Honky-tonk Superman 
Yeah, That's Who I Really Am 
A Real Rebel, Dare-devil, Honky-tonkin' Superman 
Yeah, Sure Enough, Real Tough, Honky-tonk Superman
