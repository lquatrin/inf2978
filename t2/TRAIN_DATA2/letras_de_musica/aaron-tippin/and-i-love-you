That alarm sounds without warning
I wake up and say good morning
And I love you

I know sometimes you're still sleeping
I still whisper, Babe I'm leavin'
And I love you

You need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
This is something I will always do
Yeah the sun IT shines, the river winds, and the bluebirds sing
And I love you

While I work I curse the boss
And I anticipate gettin' off
And I love you

Oh and there's a little place
Where everybody goes at 5 o'clock
But I drive straight home,
'Cause I love you, honey

Oh, You need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
It's something I will always do
Yeah the sun IT shines, the river winds, and the bluebirds sing
And I love you

Oh, You need to know this ain't some kind of sometimes thing
It's something I will always do
Yeah the sun IT shines, the river winds, and the bluebirds sing
And I love you
Oh, I love you

Me holdin' you and you holdin' me
Every night I fall asleep
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you
