With their mouths of the floor
Begging they starve
Begging they starve
But you just walk right over them
Stepping on their teeth
You canÂ’t provide for them
With your whorish ways
The lights dim once again
For you
YouÂ’re center stage once again
For them
WonÂ’t you give us one last goodbye?
WonÂ’t you give us one last dance?
WonÂ’t you give us one last spread leg goodbye?
So we can end this broken night
And you can climb into your stained sheets with whom you choose
Just donÂ’t forget their cries
Just donÂ’t forget their cries
DonÂ’t forget their cries
DonÂ’t neglect their cries
DonÂ’t neglect their cries
