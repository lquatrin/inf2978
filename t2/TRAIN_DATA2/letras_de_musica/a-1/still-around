Christian: In this life of uncertainty 
There are people that we all need 
Someone to face you, with no disgiuse 
P C: In you there's a remedy 
That makes everyday seem trouble free 
No distance and no divice 

P C: 'Cos you hear the words 
When no one understands 

All: When my world has come undone 
And I've lost my setting sun 
When all I see are clouds 
You're still around 
When I fall into a tear 
Inspirations disappear 
You clear away that doubt 
'cos you're still, you're still around 

Mark: Now I've stumbled of uncertainty 
Never thought this could ever be 
No contradictions left inside 
M P: When I feel the rain come my ay 
You give me sun, you're my brighter day 
Intuition's telling me to say 
M P: 'Cos you hold the words 
When nothing's left to say 

Chorus 

Ben: In this life of uncertainty 
There are people that we all need 
Someone to face you, with no disgiuse 
B P: In you there's a remedy 
That makes everyday seem trouble free 
No distance and no divice 

B P: 'Cos you hold the words 
When nothing's left to say 

Chorus Repeat x 2
