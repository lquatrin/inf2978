Dont speak, seal your lips 
Please dont say a word 
Maybe I wont remember the words I have not heard 
I see, that youre in love, I know its not with me 
But I dont want the truth to haunt my memory 

Its never to late to relight the fire 
It never stopped burning for me 
The flame, it never died inside of me 

Chorus: How is it now that I can tell you I love you 
How is it only now that its too late 
What can I do, the love that we had is torn in two 
So you take the smiles from all of our years 
And Ill take the tears 

I sit and reminisce, of times that we once shared 
You gave me more than love 
But never thought I cared 
My feelings were all for you 
Although I didnt show 
I only told you on the day you let me go 

Its never to late to relight the fire 
It never stopped burning for me 
The flame, it never died inside of me 

Chorus: How is it now that 

Now I realise that youre no longer mine 
But Im hoping that the pain will ease in time 
Although youre leaving, I wont say goodbye 
Because I know youre here with me inside 

Chorus: How is it now that
