Ben:I said I'd never leave you. 
I said that I would never let you down. 
I needed a chance to prove my love to 
you 
til' time is through 

Mark:Th promises I gave you, 
I never meant to see them left untrue. 
You were my everything, I give my 
heart to you - to start anew. 

Christian:And all of the days just pass 
me by. 
So I pray, and I'm asking why 

Ben:All that I ask is one more try. 
Cos I never wanna say goodbye. 

All:If only I listen to my heart. 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart. 
Now all I can dream about is you. 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I'd never be untrue. 
Cos all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do. 

Christian:You're looking for another 
I'm looking for a chance with you again 
I guess I never showed you 
What you mean to be 
Can't you see. 

Paul:Everything I told you, 
And everything I did I feel was wrong 
I didn't know the words I said would 
Make you leave, please believe 

Mark:And all of the days just pass 
me by. 
So I pray, and I'm asking why 

Ben:All that I ask is one more try. 
Cos I never wanna say goodbye 

All:If only I listen to my heart. 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart. 
Now all I can dream about is you. 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I'd never be untrue. 
Cos all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 

P C:If only,if only,if only, all I do 
If only,if only,if only, all I do x2 

B M:If only I listen to my heart, 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart. 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 

All:If only I listen to
