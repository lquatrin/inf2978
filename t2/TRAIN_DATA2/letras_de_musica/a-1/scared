I've walked 
the jungle 
Fought a lion with bare hands 
The Prince of Darkness 
I'm a far better man! 

I've crossed the desert, 
Never feared for my own 
Where lightning strikes - I'll always go! 

Eye of the tiger, not afraid to attack 
Left Frankenstein - flat on his back 
That witches` magic, just aint nothing to see 
Cos` you are the one, who cast a spell onto me!! 

If you're looking for danger, here I come 
You better look out, it's just begun 
There's something that I want you to know 

Chorus: The one thing that I'm scared of 
Is losing hold of you 
I get the shivers down my spine 
Feel my body turning blue 
The feeling is so frightening 
It's driving me insane 
Chorus: The one thing that I'm scared of 
Is losing hold of you 

The Terminator - said he never be back 
Fight fire with fire that's a natural fact 

Tell me your nightmare, and I'll give you my dream 
I will protect you - whenever you scream 

Because you're always there 
To let me know - sometimes we all get scared 
I'm telling you I can't let you go 

Chorus - ad libs 

I can feel it in the air, and my fever's going down 
There's a chill across the town 

The one thing that I'm scared of is 
Losing hold of you
