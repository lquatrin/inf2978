You say you're 
gonna work it out 
Then you say you're having doubts 
Tellin' me you'll walk away 
But then you go and stay 
You're callin' me day and night 
Sayin' he don't treat you right 
Then you always turn around 
And give him one more try 

Baby you know it isn't fair 
You expect me to be there 
But we never get nowhere 

Chorus 
I got one foot out the door 
I don't wanna hear 'bout him no more 
I'll make a long story short 
Time to make up your mind, girl 
No more back and forth 
I don't wanna hear 'bout him no more 
If I'm not what you want 
I don't wanna hear no more 

Stop tellin' me you need more time 
Tired of the same old line 
Better make a move or you are gonna find 
I ain't taken it 
Cuz you know it's wrong 
Better let him know it's time to go 
You're movin' on 
Baby you don't know how close 
I am to being gone 

Baby you know it isn't fair 
You expect me to be there 
But we never get nowhere 

Chorus 

I don't wanna hear no more 
If you're sure that you really love me 
I don't wanna hear no more 
Out the door if you still don't know 
I been there for you 
And you know it's true 
You belong with me 
What you gonna do 

Chorus
