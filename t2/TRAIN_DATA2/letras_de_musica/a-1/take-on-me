Talking away 
I don't know what I'm to say 
I'll say it anyway 
Today's another day to find you 
Shine Away 
I'll be coming for you love okay 

Take on me (take on me) 
Take me on (take on me) 
I'll be gone in a day or two 

So needless to say at odds and ends 
But I'll be stumbling away 
Slowly learning that life is okay 
Say after me 
It's so much better to be safe than sorry 

Take on me (take on me) 
Take me on (take on me) 
I'll be gone in a day or two 

Oh, things that you say 
Yeah, is it life or just a play 
My worries away 
You're all the things I've got to remember 
You shine away 
I'll be coming for you anyway 

Take on me (take on me) 
Take me on (take on me) 
I'll be gone in a day or two 
Take on me (take on me) 
Take me on (take on me) 
I'll be gone in a day or two 

Take on me 
Take on me
