Ben:And as I look into your eyes 
I see an angel in disguise 
Sent from God above 
For me to love

And as I hold your body near

You face the thunder 
When the sunshine to rain 
Just like a rose 

You treat me like a rose 
You give me room to grow 
You shone the light of love on me 
And give me air so I
