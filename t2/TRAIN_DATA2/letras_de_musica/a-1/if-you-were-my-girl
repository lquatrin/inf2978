If you were my girl 
Aching to see the sun again 
Aching to see your eyes to see how they shine 
They make this world a better place 
Aching to see you smile again 
Aching to hear you laugh and say Im not dreaming 
When you caress my hair 
Your touch so warm and gentle baby 
Then I can see true happiness at last 

Chorus: 
If you would be my girlfriend 
Then I would be in heaven 
Then I could do anything 
Id stand on my head and sing 
If you were my girl 
2 x 

I wish I could feel your lips right now 
Wish I could let my hand 
Glide through your hair 
I wish I could softly hold your hand 
I wish I could tell you every dream 
I wish I could tell you everything that I feel 
I wish I could tell you that 
I need you here to kiss me baby 
If only I could get myself to say 
Hey,hey 

Chorus: 

There are so many beautiful girls in the world 
But theres only one girl that I want 
And Ive chosen today that I cant ever stay 
Unless I can stay here with you 

If you would be my girlfriend

Then I would be in heaven 
(In heaven in heaven) 
Then I could do anything

If you were my girl 
(Girlfriend)

If you would be my girlfriend 
(If you were my girl Id give you the world) 
Then I would be in heaven 
(Yeah yeah) 
Then I could do anything 
I stand on my head and sing 
If you my girl 
(If you were my girl) 
If you would be my girlfriend 
(My girlfriend) 
Then I would be in heaven 
(In heaven) 
Then I could do anything 
I stand on my head and sing 
If you were my girl 
(You know Id do it) 
If you were my
