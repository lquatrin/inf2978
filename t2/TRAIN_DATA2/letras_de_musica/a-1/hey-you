Ben:Hey you, looking around at your 
friends 
You see something about them has 
changed 
And nothing's clear 
They're not the same 
Paul:Don't you take it to heart all the 
same 
You'll see it works out better that way 
Don't be afraid to shout your name 
All:Do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
Everything is ok 
Come together and say 

All:It's alright it's alright 
You don't have to stop the way you're 
feeling 
'Cos you've got time to get it right 
Let your mind where it's leading 
It's alright it's alright 
It's alright it's alright 

Christian:Hey you, just be the best you 
can be 
You'll see the best things in life come for 
free 
Mark:Now it's all clear, no cloudy day 
If you follow your heart and believe 
You'll be excited by what you'll achieve 
Don't be afraid to find a way 
All:Oh, do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
If he think it's ok 
Mark:Come together and say 

Chorus 

All:Do what you gotta do 
The world is waiting for you 
There ain't nothing to lose 
Everybody today 
If he think it's ok 
Come together and say 

Chorus
