Belive in your heart, 
No matter what the people may say 
The chance you take could take you to the top 

Listen up- 
You know you gotta throw fear away 
Together we can make it, 
Shake it up baby 

Break: 
Hear the voices rock the nation, 
A calling to the skies 
I can see eternity,is in your eyes 
Come on everybody there's a party 
to go to 
There holding out for you! 
With every chance you take, 
a change you make 
The start of something new 

Chorus: 
All around the world they're singing, 
Calling out a new beginning 
Oh-oh-oh- celebrate our love 
Peopple with imagination 
Everywhere a celebration 
Oh-oh-oh- celebrate our love! 

Good to be free, 
Living out our own destiny 
The beat will last forever  
Never stop 

Gotta move 
You know we gotta groove into the light 
Tonight will be the night that, 
We're breaking it up 
Break it down baby 

Break - Chorus 

Oh-oh,oh-oh,na na na na na 
Oh-oh,oh-oh - celebrate our love 

Let the rhythm take control, 
Feel the fire burn within your soul 
There's a magic in your eyes, 
Forever we can take the 
Music thru the night
