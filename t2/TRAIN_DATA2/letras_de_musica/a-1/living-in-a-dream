Where have you 
been all of my life? 
Where have you come from? 
Is this your first time too? 
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime 
We're part of the great plan. 
Like to stars that shine 

I stood here watchin', while it only ever happened to friends 
Now I don't have to pretend 

(Chrorus) 
I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin that scene, we finally made it through the fire 
Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah 

True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 

I've been waiting all of my life, 
Anticipating with every dream every night 
Destiny's a moment we all share in time, love is the message 
And I know I've got mine ... 

I stood here watchin', while it only ever happened to friends 
Now I don't have to pretend 

(Chrorus) 
I can't believe we're living the dream 
We're diggin that scene, we finally made it through the fire 
Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah 

True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 

(Chrorus) 
I can't believe we're living the dream

Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah 

True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love, baby could this be 
True love, true love happenin' t
