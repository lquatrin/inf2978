Let's go...

[abs:] yo, it's hot how you do your thing.
Everything about you...
Is bootylicious, i have to... ooh!
Creep upon you as i pass you,
Wanna blast you,
But i didn't wanna ask you.

[electronic abs:] you hold on...
You telling me ya not gonna rock that body
Tickbooty with dat full black thang? damn!
[abs:] it's just the dog in me.
Got a hold of my cool side...
It's telling me.

[bridge]
[abs:] see i didn't wanna act too fast,
Wanted to take it slow.
But the dog said no.
[electronic abs:] boy, you better fix up man!
I had enough of you going home playing with your hand...
[abs:] and girl i didn't mean to touch your ass
You wouldn't even if i told you, believe me.. oh!
[electronic abs:] don't worry bout with your mind...
Yo fuck that!
Hit the dance floor, get it right!

[abs:] rock a bye baby! oh
Let your body rock this way. oh
From the front to the back, girl
Anyway you want, we can play...

Rock a bye baby. oh
Let your body rock with me.. oh!

I'm gonna put it on ya.
It's just the dog in me.

[abs:] now i want you,
Get your body closer
[electronic abs:] go on! heat it up like i told ya!
Tell her how you wanna
Zoom in the foam back seat of the ranger rover
[abs:] she's telling me, slow down
Take it slowly
Take your time boy
Get it on me
Tell me why i feel like that?
[electronic abs:] it's just the dog in you that gotta chase the cat...
