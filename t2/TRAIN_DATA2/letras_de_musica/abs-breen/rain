It's been about a couple of days gone by
When i last saw you
When you said bye-bye
Then you walked away and left me alone
All get is a dial tone
When i call your phone
Occasionally i'll roll about your way
I thought about the words that i could say
But you ain't trying to feel me
You don't even wanna' heal me

[bridge #1]
Oh
Is it my turn to cry over you?
'cos no matter what i do
Those rainy days won't leave me alone

What kind of love leaves you feeling cold
All alone with nobody to hold
Don't wanna' feel like i did that day
Let the rain wash the pain away
Sometimes i think i hear you call my name
Sometimes it's just my mind playing games
But nothings changed
It's still all the same
Let the rain wash the pain away

See your picture all up in a magazine
With some other cat i've never seen
You was looking more beautiful then you've ever been
Here come those lonely feelings again
I must be tripping on myself
'cos the fact that you're with somebody else
It's getting me down
Girl, i can't deny
I guess this is what it sounds like
When the doves cry

[bridge #2]
Oh
Did you choose girl or do it for him?
'cos no matter what i do
Those rainy days won't leave me alone
