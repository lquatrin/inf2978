Things never seemed so far away as they do right now
This time i'm all alone
Cut down and pulled beneath my feet
My world comes down around me, i'll watch it away
Time plays its gentle tune
As i always wonder how she can stand to see my face
I never thought that it would ever come to this
To see myself in her place

Breaking, i'm losing
I'm losing grip on what i know
While trying to stay on my feet
Time's passing, leaves changing
Leaving nothing but a faded memory of what i used to call my own

Well i'm locked up from inside
All that's left to do is hide
I'm understanding where we stand
Time is coming to hault
Maybe now it's time i start
To see things coming to and end

I never thought that it would ever end
That it would ever come to this
Subliminal i've traveled far
Now i've gone a long, long way
And my love will not desist before i leave this all behind
Leave this all behind
