Looking through kaleidoscopes
Believing the option of freedom
That the random assimilations of color can pose
As they wind into patterns
And their brightness flows unhindered
As their link of adornment to the eye forges a fleeting find

The pallid dreams unwind
They are alive in new light
Cause matterÂ’s just made of dust
Time is river flow
Focusing can blind
But overtones that resonate through the sound of uncertainty
Can simplify thinking in the giant scope
Not feeding a life full of needing all the air-born reticulation
The target, on wheels, as we grind into habit

And though tightened frames once kept us near
IÂ’m seeing cohesionÂ’s not enough
Can love be linked to a time?

The pallid dreams unwind
They are alive in new light
Cause motionÂ’s just made from rust
Like is river flow;
Focusing will blind and overwhelm
But let the thoughts take their course through uncertainty
And you will find you canÂ’t live for solutions
Stop before you start and accept the way things fall
ThereÂ’s so much worth uncovering by relaxing your eyes
