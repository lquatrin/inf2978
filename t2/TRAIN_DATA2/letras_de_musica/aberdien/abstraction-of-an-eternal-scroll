Clip started from the end
Now we frantically rewind
The brain pulses to show us
That this is not more than a state;
A dream inside many wave lapses
That string along the measure
Yielding for no one
Grafted skin over years of decay
And itÂ’s expected to heal

Which points are start and end?
It feels weÂ’re traveling in rewind
The brain sputters and suddenly knows
This is all just staying awake
But they react as if somethingÂ’s wielding thoughts for us
The frame is not still, but moving for a purpose

Grafted skin starts to swallow decay
And the excess doesnÂ’t feel the power
Of standing on the edge of thinking or doing
Will we act before itÂ’s too late?

ItÂ’s learning how to wait
What we want has to come in patient hours
The worldÂ’s not in flat lines
So what makes us think in nothing more?
No use if you live paralyzed
ItÂ’s for the taking
Pulse of color can be injected

And now we stand
On the edge of thinking or doing
Will we act before itÂ’s too late?
ItÂ’s learning how to wait
What we want has to come in patient hours
The worldÂ’s not in flat lines
So what makes us think in nothing more?
So wait for the off season calm
And embrace the days between heights
Looking up in descent only lures he head into false security
We are caught
