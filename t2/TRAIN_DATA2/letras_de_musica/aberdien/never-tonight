Another summer night spent alone
And if i could choose this time, i'd vow to never let you go
So come with me tonight, lets take the wind in our hair
Just tell me right now where can end up tonight
The heat is wearing on my mind
Now i'm trying to stomach what i can't bring myself to do
I'll gaze at you this one last time
Before i let you go, am i asking too much?

So there we were again driving down the highway
Would you care if i told you
How beautiful you are?
So just ask me right now before i'm lost off in the wind
Say "lets forget the past"
Oh what if that was me

What is about you that drives me so insane?
I just can't explain myself
And as i'm staring it looks like this could be
Another ride alone

And as i'm staring off into the distance
My mind is filled with thoughts, thoughts i'll never say to you
Why won't you let me move on with my life?
Why won't you let me move on?
