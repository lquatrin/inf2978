Silence comes on us again
And i don't know just why i can't seem to make the change
The air is calm, what can i do?
One too many times i've spent lamenting change that just won't stay
Soon you will be gone again, will i ever get it right?
You and i could be so alive in the world
We built between ourselves
Faster, i run chasing distractions
Now it's time i come to face myself

All i need
Is one more night just alone with your smile
All i need
To get my through this is one of our better days

(repeat)

Please don't let me go,
Please just one last kiss
Don't say goodbye just yet
My heart won't take another collapse
Before it falls right to the floor,
Before it falls through me again
