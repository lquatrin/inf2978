All sewn up except the eyes
A station of intake is all that a human is
Relying on what weÂ’re told by our senses
But itÂ’s impossible to feel
What exceeds our comprehension
Right wing tactics taking over
Leading all of us too close

Where to go from here
The skies will have to know
Where black ends
And how high does it go?
Is there white after limits again?

Left to figure out
With guns and atom bombs
As if you own it
Explosions put us here
And now weÂ’re going out the same way
Right wing tactics taking over
Leading all of us too close

It rolls in louder
DonÂ’t pay mind
This is only a chapter in the line
ItÂ’s our own disaster;
Built while blind

Hang the weight up
Is there more that matters?
Balance shifts in scales
Hang the weight up
I think thereÂ’s more to see this way

Where to go from here
The skies will have to know
Where black ends
And how high does it go?
Is there time after it hits the end?
