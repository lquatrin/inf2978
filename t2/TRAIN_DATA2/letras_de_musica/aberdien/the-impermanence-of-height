Fighting slow turns
Grip the wheel to counter placating blades and
Butterflies churning their way
Life came when we blocked the page of dull marks
From all the world scratching analogous lines

Finding height impermanent
It's all an illusion placed in front of law
Wrapped in rooms of clutter as the salve eludes us

We were tied to purpose
But i raced the clock to counter this living wasteland

With emptiness leading the way
Life came when we opted to escape from
All the world leading analogous lives

Finding height impermanent
It's all an illusion placed in front of law
Wrapped in rooms of clutter as the salve eludes us

And after all this angst precludes the top
I'll desert something and i'll be aloud to bring time
Down from the inside
I've stop letting immersion take away my head
When meeting gain can only come from failure

Finding height impermanent
It's all illusion
