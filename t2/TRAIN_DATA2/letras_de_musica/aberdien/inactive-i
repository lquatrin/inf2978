Instead of molding eyes
Take a chance on unknown odds
Facing adjacent to wind means coming out inside
Ten poles pass me on the road at test speeds
I donÂ’t understand consistency
(we were made with resistance capabilities)
Now weÂ’re racing autumnÂ’s climb

Onward despite the things that iÂ’ve found
I know now that you canÂ’t put a cap on a bursting valve

Ever think we would be so deep inside
With nowhere left to go?
Goodbye, i am leaving for good
On my way back to where i belong

So instead of holding on
IÂ’ll learn to finally let go
Complacent and facing within
IÂ’m coming out inside
Ten poles pass me on the road
I donÂ’t think
I finally feel consistency
But now weÂ’re back on autumnÂ’s time

Ever think we would be so deep inside
With nowhere left to go?
Goodbye, i am leaving for good
On my way to a home iÂ’ve never been
But i know the way somehow
So long, weÂ’re inactive together but in love alone
