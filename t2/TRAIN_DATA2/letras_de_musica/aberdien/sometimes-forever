Taking everything i've got
Just to keep my lungs from filling up with water
I'm drowning on my own, just watching you with him
Is he something that i'm not?
Sometimes it's easy enough not to see your face next to me
Solitude takes it's toll on me, one breath goes whirling by

Have i waited far too long?
Another day now i am gone
Have i forgotten what it's like to feel right without you?

I guess i will never get the chance to say you're mine forever
Losing my chance, today i'll dance all by myself forever more

Until i lose it all things won't change
If only i had known what was at stake
If i hadn't waited who knows just where we'd be
Only time could tell the words that were left unsaid
And i know why i'm crying here tonight
Never again will i ever walk away
