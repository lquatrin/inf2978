A distraught world appears in front of my eyes
If i shut them would i ever find my way back home?
A world i know and a world that i've come to accept in time
Looking around, seems that it's left behind
I guess i'll always find some way to knock down the chances that i've lost on my own
The things i've loved and the things i've known will keep on coming back to me
Over and over again
This story's been told at least a thousand times
This time i'm lost and scared that i will find
A way to see things jaded and up in smoke
The only thing to do is...

Hope, i just hope i find my way back this time
All i can do is watch this by
