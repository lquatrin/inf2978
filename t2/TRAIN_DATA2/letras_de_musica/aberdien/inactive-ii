Wait i canÂ’t breathe without you
How did one person become such part of me?
I will have to fake this
At least then iÂ’ll know that iÂ’m out of our mind tonight

Ever think we would be so far
Ever think we would be so deep inside
With nowhere left to go?
Goodbye, i am leaving for good
On my way to a home iÂ’ve never been
But i know the way somehow
So long, weÂ’ll be together if we make it on our own
