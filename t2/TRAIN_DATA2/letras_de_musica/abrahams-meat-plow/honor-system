Simple truth is what you seek
Bite your tongue, grind your teeth
So your vices are way too strong
Tell me, what has gone wrong?
The oldest trap in the book
Y'all better take a closer look

Your welcome worn before your birth
Milk your life for all it's worth
That's just fine, pay it no mind
That's just fine, this timeÂ… spitfire

An honor system that reaks of white lightning
Banish them one by one
An honor system that reaks of white lightning
That's fine, please don't misfire

Honor system
Honor this

Whatever it takes to do what i do
Whatever it takes to be me
Whatever it takes to feel the moment of truth
Whatever it takes to stay free

Whatever it takes to do what i do
Whatever it takes to stay free
Whatever it takes to feel the moment of truth
(and the nightmare continuesÂ…)

Could you change the world?
In a blink of time
Can you feel the truth
As it smothers you

Would you change the world
If the price was right
Can you kill the pain
As it smothers you

Honor system
Honor this
