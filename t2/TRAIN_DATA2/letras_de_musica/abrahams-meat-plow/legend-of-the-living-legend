Once upon a time
Not too long ago
A wise fool told me this
"It doesn't get any better than this
Sit back, relax my friend
The end is just right around the bend.
And I've seen the future,
Reveled in the past
I've been way beyond the end of time
Redesigned
Redefined
There will be hell to pay
Redefined
Redesigned
So now my ways are paved
By the words of a stranger
Yes, he informed me
As he transformed
So now I waste my days contemplating
The infinite rule 'o linguistics
And mindless statistics

Legend (of the living legend) (4 X)

Legend (hit 'em high, hit 'em low)
Legend (hit 'em low, hit 'em high) (2 X)
Lo and behold

Disappear
You disappeared
