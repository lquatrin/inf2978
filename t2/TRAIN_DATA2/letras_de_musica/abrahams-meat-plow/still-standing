Broken down I'm feeling so spent
Holes in my memory feeling regret

I'm standing
Still standing
I'm standing still

Forever grabbing at what I can't contain
Swallow my pride as I swallow the pain

Rectify kill the lie
And push yourself until you come alive
Stick and move, shuck and jive
And push yourself to stay alive (x2)

Tension mounting
A bomb that's self contained
A constant struggle as I live through the charade

I'm standing
Still standing
I'm standing still but standing true
I'm standing
Still standing
I'm standing still, still standing true
