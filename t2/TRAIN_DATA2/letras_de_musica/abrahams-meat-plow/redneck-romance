I got my 454 down on the floor
Haulin' ass and drunk as hell
My '77 Chevy becomes a death machine
For anyone in my way

I got a mouth full of chewy chaw
Got a bottle full of 'shine
A package full of Pall Mall
And a jug full o' wine
My guns are locked and loaded
And so am I.

Redneck romance
Inside of me
Redneck romance
It'll always be
(2 X)

Well, I'm a hell bent redneck
Straight form the hills
I got a case full of shells
And some time to kill
Around these parts
My word is law
If my pa saw me now
He'd be damn proud of me

Well, I'm the one with the neck so red
Well, I'm the one who could care less
My sister and wife are one in the same
The kids are inbred and I'm insane

Redneck romance
Inside of me
Redneck romance
It'll always be
(2 X)

Well, I'd round up a posse
But I've got no friends
I've got a tree just for hangin'
And it's time to cleanse
And I take great pride
In cleanin' my guns
And I shoot 'em off most times
Just for fun

Redneck romance
Inside of me
Redneck romance
It'll always be

Upstate, Motherfucker
