Mountain stompin', rippin', rompin'
Crushin' down like a mack truckin'
Appalachian armageddon,
Run for the hills, the sun's a settin'

Under dark skies, rollin' snake eyes
When is murder justified?
Dirty needles and well dressed lies
The squirming coil with blood pressed eyes

And it comes crushin'
Crushin' down
Ten thousand times the sky
And i'll never know the reason why
It used to make me sick
Just to open my eyes

Backwards and inhumane
Backwoods, always the same
Backwards and inhumane
Backwoods, always the same
This is the ending in the making
The ending in the making

Mason dixon's all the fixins
Auto pilot crucifixions
Hit 'em where it hurts
Kick 'em when they're down
A cross faced chicken wing
Splits a man's crown

Mason dixon's all the fixins
Auto pilot crucifixions
Hit 'em where it hurts
Kick 'em when they're down
A cross faced chicken wing
Splits a man's crown
Splits a man's crown

Backwards and inhumane
Backwoods, always the same
Backwards, backwoods,
Backwards and inhumane
This is the ending in the making
