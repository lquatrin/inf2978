You recall when he hated me 
And pretended that he didn't see 
And he glanced a cast in your direction 
And you did it for your own protection 

Like the way that you shell the peas 
Only wish you were shelling me 
Like the way that you dance when you're in the kitchen 
Bodies rockin' and your moves are bitchin' 

Been a regular for so long 
But you treat me like there's something wrong 
When I let you know you are looking lovely 
Tell me is it really awful of me 

Got the touch when your making tea, yeah 
And you wish that you've taken me 
Ooh like spring time takes the winter 
The only thing I ever get is splinters 

From your chair in your vegetarian restaurant 
Ooh your vegetarian restaurant 
Your everywhere in your vegetarian restaurant 
Ooh your vegetarian restaurant 

Don't you know I'm dying deep inside 
This restaurant is all I want 
So keep it all beside, yeah 

I don't cry a lot, it's true 
When I do, I do it over you 
There's times I can't believe your even human 
Sweet and modest and as unassuming 
As the tableware in your vegetarian restaurant 
Ooh your vegetarian restaurant
