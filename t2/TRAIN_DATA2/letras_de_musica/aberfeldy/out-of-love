So sad you're leaving 
You're sorry too 
But there's no point in grieving 
What good does it do 

Time and time 
I've tried to make you change your mind 
Cared so much about you 
Girl, my love is blind 

My love is blind, girl 
It's deaf and it's dumb 
You treat me unkind, girl 
I'm under your thumb 

I was thinking of a place 
I never told you of 
That's the type of thing that happens 
When you're out of love 

For the first time 
And maybe the last 
No hope for the future 
And none in the past 

So I sit in my bedroom 
Stare at the wall 
Find myself wondering 
What's the point of it all 
Find it hard to think of how to spend the day 
Ever since the one I love has gone away 

Time and time 
I've tried to make you change your mind 
Cared so much about you 
Girl, my love is blind
