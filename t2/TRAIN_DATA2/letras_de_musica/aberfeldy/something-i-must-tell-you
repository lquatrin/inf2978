Something I must tell you, 
Must believe it's true, 
There is nothing in the world 
as beautiful as you 

Oh little girl, 
Misunderstood, 
The finest wine and the finest food, 
I'll build you, you're own Hollywood, 
Do it all for you x2 

Got something I must tell you, 
Must believe it's true, 
There is nothing in this world, 
I wouldn't do for you 

Oh limousines, private jets 
Seventeen fakers yet, 
All the best that you can get, 
Do it all for you x2 

Got something I must tell you, 
Must believe it's true, 
There is nothing in this world, 
I wouldn't do for you 

Well we had a good thing going, 
Shoulda kept it going on, 
Nothing would go bad for us, 
Nothing would go wrong 

But I saw the look you gave him, 
And I saw him fall for you, 
And I saw him get to know you, 
There was nothing I could do x2 

Got something I must tell you
