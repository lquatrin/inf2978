I love everyone 
Everybody underneath the sun 
I think you're all the most amazing fun 

When I'm very high, I can't help but wonder why 
You gotta be such a butterfly 
Oh well, I don't mind when you land on me 
I just wish you'd stop fluttering your butter.. 
Or what may seem... 

Back when you were young 
You ran around with every mother's son 
I can't believe half of the things you've done 

I know cause I'm the same 
I threw a lot of what I was away 
And I'm all confused today 
And I'll take anything you hand to me, 
If I don't know any better than you I will agree... 

With a friend like you, baby, what would I do? 
I think about it all of the time 
Till we stick like glue, when it's easy to do 
Or do I wait until you've made up your mind? 
Can I wait until you've made up your mind? 

Girl one thing I know 
Until the day that you let me go 
I'm gonna let my loving flow 
Like wine and water out of Jesus' jug 
And all that rubbish that you talk on drugs 

With a friend like you, baby, what would I do? 
I think about it all of the time 
Till we stick like glue, when it's easy to do 
Or do I wait until you've made up your mind? 

With a friend like me, girl, it's easy to see 
Things'll go wrong all the time 
But if little by little, we could meet in the middle 
I'll be yours, and baby you will be mine 
And now I'll wait until you've made up your mind...
