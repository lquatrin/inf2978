Surly girl, you got all the glamour in the world 
But you make my toes and fingers curl 
The way you smile, as though it's going out of style 

You're a funny one, should be having lots of fun 
But you're dwelling on the things you've done 
There in the past, believe me girl, it doesn't last 

Artisan Philosophers tried to run away with her 
For their love, she couldn't care 
She's waiting for a millionaire 

I watch you dear, count the Gypsies, spin the wheel 
But tell me that you never feel a little sad 
To think of what you could have had 

Artisan Philosophers tried to fire into her 
This girl is tearing out her hair 
Waiting for a millionaire 

I understand, you've found yourself a wealthy man 
He got you eating from his hand 
And now you know, exactly where the money goes 

But they brought you in, made you tell a tail on him 
There was no way that you could win 
It's just a question of when, gonna see you face in the papers again 

Artisan Philosophers tried to win the heart of her 
They're up here, but she's down there 
Waiting for a millionaire
