One, two, a one two three

Well we get along
Yeah we really do
And there's nothing wrong
With what I feel for you

I could go with you, you, you if you want me to
I could hang around
'Till the leaves are brown
And the summer's gone.

What a silly thing
For me to say to you
As the spring begins
To begin anew

And I know that it's hard, hard, hard when you're loving it's hard
And the leaves are brown
And they're falling down
And the summer's gone

And I can't wait anymore for you
I spent the weekend
You're giving me nothing
And I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

But I won't give up
And I won't give in
And I know it's tough
But I need to win

And I couldn't get away from you
Even if I wanted to
So I hang around
'Till the leaves are brown
And the summer's gone

And I can't wait anymore for you
I spent the weekend
You're giving me nothing
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

I can't wait anymore for you
I spent the weekend
You're giving me nothing
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

And I can't wait anymore for you
I can't wait anymore for you
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

I can't wait anymore for you
I can't wait anymore for you
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

What I got to do
And what I got to see
It was only you
And it was only me

And I know that it's hard, hard, hard when you're loving it's hard
And the leaves are brown
And they're falling down
And the summer's gone

And I can't wait anymore for you
I spent the weekend
You're giving me nothing
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.

I can't wait anymore for you
I spent the weekend
You're giving me nothing
I can't wait anymore for you
The feeling's strong
The summer's gone.
