I always used to have someone to come home to 
But knowing there is no one waiting's frustrating 
How I miss the love she gave me 
I need her to come and save me from myself 

All the love in the world 
Could never be enough for her 
I'm so lonely, now she's gone 
All I do is tie one on 

The love we had that once was cherished is perished 
There ain't no part of me she wants to hold on to 
I feel as though I can't go on 
I can't believe she's really gone away from me 

All the love in the world 
Could never be enough for her 
You find me sleeping on the lawn 
Cause I've been in tied one on 

But if I could get her on my own, I'd be alright 
That's when I know she's mine 

The love we had that once was sacred is wasted 
I never even knew her reasons for leaving 
Now every day I do the same thing 
I become so uncomplaining, don't know why 

All the love in the world 
Could never be enough for her 
I'm so lonely, now she's gone 
All I do is tie one on 

Oh all the love in the world 
Could never be enough for her 
You find me sleeping on the lawn 
Cause I've been in tied one on
