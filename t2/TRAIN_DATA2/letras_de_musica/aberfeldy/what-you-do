You cannot begin to imagine the state I was in 
The first time you spoke to me, I felt my life starting again 
And I haven't felt this way since I don't know when 
I know you love her, I only wish that it were you 
I'd do anything in the world to have you believe 
That I only want you girl, I don't want sympathy 

Oooh, you don't even know what you do 
(All I can think of is you) 
Oooh, all I can think of is you 
(All I want is you) 
All that I want in the world is to know that you're near 
The sound of your voice is the only thing I want to hear 
Oooh baby, losing you should my only fear 
Oooh, you don't even know what you do 
Oooh, I've fallen in love with you 

Only by holding you close could I hope to feel whole 
And only your love girl, could help heal the hurt in my soul 
There's nobody else who will do, there's no one at all 

Oooh, you don't even know what you do 
(All I can think of is you) 
Oooh, I've fallen in love with you 
(All I want is you) 
Oooh, it's easy to say when it's true 
Oooh, I've fallen in love with you
