I'm an open book 
That you can take a look 
There's nothing I have found 
Could slow my yo-yo down 

Don't you slow me down 
I could be seeing stars 
I could be behind bars 
I could be in the ground 
So don't you slow me down 
Don't ever slow me down 

I know the sky is blue 
And I'll fall for you 
I know the world is round 
Don't ever slow me down 

Don't slow me down, slow me down 
Don't slow me down, slow me down 

The way you smile at me 
The way you let it be 
The way you never frown 
The way you slow me down 
Don't you slow me down 

Don't slow me down, slow me down 
Don't slow me down, slow me down 

Cause there's a side of me 
That you could never see, 
That no one's ever found 
Don't ever slow me down 

I know the sky is blue, and I'll fall for you 
I know the world is round 
Don't ever slow me down 

Don't show me nothing's what it seems 
Can't throw my arms around a dream 
Yeah yeah 

There's a side of me 
That you will never see 
That no one's ever found 
Don't ever slow me down 

We got a world to win 
We'll get it back again 
I cannot mess around 
Don't ever slow me down 
Don't ever slow me down
