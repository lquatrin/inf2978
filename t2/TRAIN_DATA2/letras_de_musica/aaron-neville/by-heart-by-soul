If You were a road
I'd learn every turn til I 
Could find my way with my eyes closed
If You were a song
I'd sing along til I
Knew every word and every note

But you were everything to me
A mystery
Your the Love I live to see

By heart, by soul
Thats how I want to know You
Keep you as close as
Breath is to life
Wanna watch your love unfold
By heart, by heart, by soul

If You were a place
I'd stay my whole life til I
Had every corner memorized
And if You were a star
You were a star
I'd follow You home, You would be
The Light that is my only guide

You were everything to me
My A to Z
You were everything to me
It would be forever eternity

By heart, by soul
Thats how I want to know you
Keep you as close as
Breath is to life
Wanna watch your love unfold
By heart, by heart, by soul

I wanna know you inside and out
Better than I even know myself

By heart, by heart, by soul, by soul
Thats how I want to know you
Keep you as close as
Keep you as close as
Breath is to life
Breath is to life
I wanna watch your love
Sweet sweet love unfold
My heart

My heart, my heart, my soul, my soul
Thats how I want to know you
Thats how I want to know you
Keep you as close as
Keep you as close as
Breath is to life
Breath is to life
Wanna watch your love unfold
By heart, by heart, by soul, by soul

If You were a star
I'd follow You home by heart
By soul
