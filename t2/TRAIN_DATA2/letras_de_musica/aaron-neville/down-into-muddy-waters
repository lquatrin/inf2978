Now you left me here and went out on the town 
I don't know when I've been so down 
The sky is dark, 
The moon is blue 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water 

Well the National Anthem has come and gone, 
I still got the TV on, 
And white noise, 
A blue moon, 
Sitting here waiting up on you, 
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water 

The clock on the wall keeps rollin' on, 
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 
Baby, you still ain't home 

Well, I've fought some sleep, 
In a straight back chair 
Morning comes and you still ain't here, 
Roll on, I've had enough, 
Holding on to faithless love, 
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water. 

The clock on the wall keeps rollin' on, 
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 
And baby, you still ain't home, 
Now you left me here and went out on the town, 
I don't know when I've been so down, 
The sky is dark, 
the moon is blue, 
I don't know what I'm gonna do, 
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water 
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water 
I'm falling down into muddy water 
I'm falling down into muddy water 
I'm falling down into muddy water 
I'm falling down into muddy water 
I'm falling down into muddy water
