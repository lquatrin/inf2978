(Hey little Alice, hey little Alice) 

I know a little girl 
Lives down the street (hey little Alice) 
She's a rockin' little mama, 
And she sure is sweet (hey little Alice) 
She comes out early 
With the rising sun (hey little Alice) 
She comes back in the evening 
When the day is done (hey little Alice) 
Night time comes 
And she's out again (hey little Alice) 
Well this time, this is where 
The fun begins (hey little Alice) 
Down at the corner 
There's a local dance (hey little Alice) 
Every weekend there's 
A local band (hey little Alice) 
Featuring nothing 
But rock and roll (hey little Alice) 
Alice wouldn't miss this 
To save her soul (hey little Alice) 
(Hey little Alice, hey little Alice) 

I went to the corner 
And walked in the door (hey little Alice) 
Alice as usual 
Had took the floor (hey little Alice) 
Like the girl with 
The red dress on (hey little Alice) 
She could shake that thing 
All night long (hey little Alice) 
Right behind me 
I heard some people say (hey little Alice) 
She never quits until 
The band stops playing (hey little Alice) 
(Hey little Alice, hey little Alice) 

I'm talking about Alice now, 
You know she's alright (hey little Alice) 
I said she's alright now, 
I said she's my girl (hey little Alice) 
I'm talking about Alice now, 
I'm talking about Alice now 
Oh yeah now, I said come on, come on
