You know night after night these guys 
Are setting up, hooking up, 
Climbing past the sky
They don't really get no praise, 
So I wrote this song in honor of them, 
Cause without them there'd be no show

So get a roadie song, 
After all he ain't no bum 
Give a roadie a hand, 
He's really part of the band 

Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie song 
Them speakers weigh a ton 
His work is never done 
So get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie song 

Got a mighty long ways to travel 
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel 
He's gotta long long ways to go 
And if he don't make it, 
There ain't gonna be no show 

So give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie song 
He climbed to Kingdom Come 
He's up to see the sun 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie song 

He's got a mighty long ways to travel 
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel 
He's gotta long long ways to go 
And if he don't make it, 
There ain't gonna be no show 

Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie song, 
After all he ain't no bum 
And give a roadie a hand, 
He's really part of the band 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie song 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie, 
Get a roadie song 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give a roadie song 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give the roadie, 
Give a roadie song
