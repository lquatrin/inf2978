Our Father
Which art in heaven
Hallowed would be thy name
Thy Kingdon come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day
Our daily bread
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the Kingdom
And the Power and the Glory
Forever
Amen
