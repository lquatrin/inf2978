All you fear, is fear its self
Check our your own back yard before you check out someone else

Railroad track, in my neighbourhood
AinÂ’t no trains around that part just ainÂ’t no good

Wanna know, whatÂ’s going down,
When the pimp on the corner looks like the sharpest cat in town

Jungle rule, canÂ’t be no fool
Might get caught by the hook of a crook no time for cool

Look out jay, what you say, what you carrying brother
I hope youÂ’re clean cause the man is mean, donÂ’t come another further

We all know the answer, will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load, right along with mine

Thank you maÂ’am, mister please
Â‘Cause I must be Hercules
I must be Hercules

Like a bird, on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing

I can feel the pressure, from every side
If you ainÂ’t gonna help, donÂ’t hurt, just pass me by

Oh, no

Hercules
I must be Hercules

Jungle rule, canÂ’t be no fool
Devil is on the loose, no coo
Got your feet, in the sand
Got to be down with the cats that around and still got the face the man

Talk about me if you please but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules

DuckinÂ’ rocks, catchinÂ’ stones
MovinÂ’ how can I survive whatÂ’s going on
Big steely borrow
Somehow IÂ’ve got to make it to tomorrow

CanÂ’t depend, on no-one else
CominÂ’ up the hard way IÂ’ve got to save myself

Must be Hercules
I must be Hercules
Talk about me if you please
I must be hercules
