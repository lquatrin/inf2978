Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry 
I'll not say my last good bye 
Whoa, so don't cry, don't cry, 
Little darlin' don't cry 
Cause I'll return someday 

So don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' 
No, no don't weep 
My heart tells me you're in love with me 
Whoa, so don't weep, don't weep, 
Little darlin' don't weep 
Cause I'll return someday soon 

(To take you in my arms) 
And to squeeze you tight 
(To capture all your charms) 
Every, every, every day now 
Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' 
No don't cry 
I'm not saying my last good bye 
Whoa, no don't cry, don't cry, 
Little darlin' don't cry 
I'll return someday, 
Someday soon (someday soon) 

Whoa, don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' 
Don't, don't you cry 
Cause I'm not saying my last good bye 
Whoa, don't cry, no, no, no, don't cry
