There was a child named Bernadette 
I heard the story long ago 
She saw the Queen of Heaven once 
And kept the vision in her soul 
No one believed what she had seen 
No one believed what she heard 
But there was sorrows to be 
And mercy, mercy in this world 

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine 
Torn by what we've done and can't undo 
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do 

We've been around, we fall, we fly 
We mostly fall, we mostly run 
And every night, and then we try 
To mend the damage that we've done 
Tonight, tonight I can not rest 
I've got this joy inside my breast 
To think that I did not forget that child 
That song of Bernadette 

So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine 
Torn by what we've done and can't undo 
I just want to hold, come on let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do 
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you 
Like Bernadette would do
