Well my friends feel it's their appointed duty 
They keep trying to tell me 
All you want to do is use me 
Well my answer said all that use me stuff 
Is I wanna spread the news 
That if it feels this good getting used 
Oh you just keep on using me 
Until you use me up 
Uh huh, until you use me up 

Well my brother, you know 
He sit me right down and he talked to me 
Well he told me, that 
I ought not let you just walk on me 
(Well, you too big for that boy) 
Well I'm sure he meant well 
You know but when our talk was through 
I just said now brother if you only knew 
You'd wish that you were in my shoes 
Oh you just keep on using me 
Until you use me up 
Uh huh, until you use me up 

Well sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me 
Well you get me in a crowd of high class people 
And then you act real rude to me 
But oh baby, baby, baby, baby 
When you love me I can't get enough 

And I said I wanna spread the news 
That if it feels this good getting used 
Oh you just keep on using me 
(Come on now) 
Until you use me up 
Until you use me up

Talking 'bout you using me 
Well it all depends on what you do 
It ain't too bad the way you're using me 
Cause I sure am using you 
To do the things you do 
Uh huh, until you use me up 
Oh no, Oh no, until you use me up 
Until you use me up 
Until you use me up 
Baby, just keep on using 
Oh no, until you use me up 
Until you use me up 
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Until you use me up 
Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky 
Until you use me up
