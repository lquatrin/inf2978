I believed I could see a day 
You would want me, like I want you 
You would need me, like I need you to 
There was a moment I thought 
Time might change your mind 
And there'd be a place there 
For me in your life 

But I can't change the way you don't feel 
And I can't make you see 
What you're heart won't see 
And I can't make you need 
What you say you don't need 
I can't change you, baby, 
I can't change the way you don't feel 

And now as I walk away, 
I won't look back, I won't break down 
What I was living for, 
I'll have to live without 
There will be moments I'll think 
How it might have been 
But, baby, now this is how it must end 

Cause I can't change the way you don't feel 
And I can't make you see 
What you're heart won't see 
And I can't make you need 
What you say you don't need 
I can't change you, baby, 
I can't change the way you don't feel 

No, I can't change the way you don't feel 
And I can't make you see 
What you're heart won't see 
And I can't make you need 
What you say you don't need 
I can't change you baby 
You never gonna change you baby, no 
I can't change you baby, 
I can't change the way you don't feel
