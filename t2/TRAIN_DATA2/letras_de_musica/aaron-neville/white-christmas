I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones i used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card i write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white.

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every christmas card i write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your christmases be white.
