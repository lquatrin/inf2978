Looking in your eyes 
Is like looking through a window 
Seeing clear skies of days gone by 
Of happiness, imaginning sweet visions 
Of your loveliness 
Oh and your tenderness 

Makes me want to cry, 
For the love that we've shared 
It makes me feel alive to know that you care 
Hold you through the night, 
Let me lie in your arms 
Tonight I want to love you, girl 
'Til the morning comes and look into your eyes 

Your sweet and smiling eyes 
Take me to paradise 
It makes me want to cry tears of joy 
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes 

When I see your face, oh and 
You hold me in your warm embrace 
I feel so safe 
Your amazing grace calms me through the fire 
Or the rainy days and the clouds it brings 

Makes me want to cry, 
For the love that we've shared 
It makes me feel alive to know that you care 
Hold you through the night 
Let me lie in your arms 
Tonight I want to love you, girl 
'Til the morning comes 
And look into your eyes 

Your sweet and smiling eyes, 
Hold me, darling 
Take me to paradise 
Your an angel, it makes me want to cry 
Tears of joy whenever I see 
Your sweet and smiling eyes 

Could you be an angel 
From up above, from up above 
So beautiful, beautiful, wonderful 
Sent down from heaven for me to love 
Oh I love you girl 

Your sweet smiling eyes, 
Your sweet and smiling eyes 
Take me to paradise 
It makes me want to cry 
Tears of joy whenever I see 
Your sweet and smiling eyes, 
Sweet and smiling eyes 
Your sweet and smiling eyes, 
Your sweet and smiling eyes 
Sweet and smiling eyes, 
Take me to paradise, paradise 
It makes me want to cry, tears of joy 
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes
