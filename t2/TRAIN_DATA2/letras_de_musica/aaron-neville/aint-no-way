Ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me 
It ain't no way for me 
To give you all you need 
If you won't let me give all of me 

I know that a mans duty 
Is to have and love a woman 
And that's the way it was planned 
Oh but how can I, how can I, 
How can I give you all the things I can 
If you're tying both of my hands 

It ain't no way, it ain't no way, 
Just ain't no way, ain't no way, baby 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me 

Stop trying to be someone you're not 
The hard cold truth is, woman, 
You paid too much for what you got 
And if you need me, baby, 
Say, say you do, 
Baby, I , baby, baby, 
Don't you know that I need you 

It ain't no way 
I tell you that it ain't no way, 
It ain't no way, it ain't no way baby, 
Baby, baby, baby 
Just ain't no way, sure ain't no way 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me
