Oh Amelia, oh Amelia 
A southern woman, a southern woman 
Never had a chance to say goodbye 

I met her back in sixty-three, 
She was such a mystery 
She was there on Barron Street, 
Down in New Orleans 
So wild, but yet so tame, 
She could calm a hurricane 
She was only seventeen 
And Amelia was her name 

Oh when I took her for a ride, 
She got close by my side 
And when I looked into her eye, 
Amelia kept me hypnotized 
But in my heart she fell, 
Oh, I got pulled into her spell 
I can still see her there, 
With the flowers in her hair 

Oh Amelia, my southern woman, oh my woman 
I can still feel you, feel you, 
Feel you, everytime I close my eyes 
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia 
Where did you run to 
We never had a chance to say goodbye 
Never heard her say goodbye 

I remember making love 
Underneath the stars above 
I can feel the summer breeze 
Up in magnolia trees 
That night in the southern light, 
The girl she took me by the hand 
I was weak as a little lamb, 
But I became a man 

Love was pumping through my veins, 
Her lips were sweet like sugarcane 
We rode all night in the rain, 
'Cross lake Poncetrain 
She had a heart as fine as fire, 
Burning innocent desire 
I can still see her there, 
With flowers in her hair 

Oh Amelia, oh Amelia 
A southern woman, a southern woman 
I can still feel you, 
Everytime I close my eyes 
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia 
Where did you run to, where'd you run to 
We never had a chance to say goodbye 
Never want to say goodbye 

Just like a shooting star, 
She vanished in the night 
But I'll always remember 
Her lips so warm and tender 
And in my heart 
She'll always shine so bright 
Sweet Amelia, if I could just 
See her one more time 

Oh Amelia, my southern woman 
A southern woman, 
I can still feel you, oh I can feel you, 
Everytime I close my eyes, close my eyes 
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia 
Where did you run to 
We never had a chance to say goodbye 
(Never, never, never, never never say goodbye) 

Oh Amelia, oh Amelia 
A southern woman, a southern woman 
I can still feel you, 
Everytime I close my eyes 
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia 
Where did you run to 
We never had a chance to say goodbye 

Oh Amelia, a southern woman, 
A southern woman 
I can still feel you, 
Everytime I close my eyes, 
From the bottom of my heart 
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia, 
Where did you run to 
Where did you run to 
We never had a chance to say goodbye
