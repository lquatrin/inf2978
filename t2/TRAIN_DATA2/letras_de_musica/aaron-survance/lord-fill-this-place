Still working out the chord Chart and setup for this song

If you filled this place with mercy
Lord, Who could stand
If our hearts cried out with love
Would Angels fall down in praise

Would Angels fall to their knees in praise

O Lord we ... Throw up, our unclean hands
Your Presence.... Falls Down, who could stand
And As we... Cry Out, fill this place
Your Mercy... Flows Down, like tears on my face

When the Nations cry with one voice
You will heal our lands
When we join with Angels singing
You will shake this very earth in our praise

Shake this very earth in our praise
We shout and.... (Replace O Lord We

When the Nations cry with one voice
You will heal our lands
When we join with Angels singing
You will shake this very earth in our praise

Chorus:

To Our First Love we lift our voice and sing
We bow down before our Lord and King
Come fill us with your passion and desire
Wash our feet and cleanse us in your fire
We seek your face not just your hand
O Lord today in you who could stand....
To our First Love
