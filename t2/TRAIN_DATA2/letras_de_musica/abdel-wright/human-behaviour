Why medication so expensive?
Tough luck life threatening diseases
Hope IÂ’m not too interrogative
Why if your money less that means you can live?
IÂ’m talking health members
Pharmaceutical companies, doctors,
Manufacturers of drugs please remember
HumanityÂ’s the key and not cash numbers

Chorus
What have we come to?
Let us look into ourselves
We need a rescue
Your conscience can be your hell
Long time you a pressure me sister
Tek it a little bit easy on me brother
Can you ever try to change it mister
Or is it human behaviour?
Long time you a pressure me sister
Tek it a little bit easy on me brother
Can you ever try to change it mister
Or is it human behaviour?

I no really have a problem with tax
But when it gone too high thatÂ’s whack
Property owners canÂ’t relax
Greed is the systems negative attack
Food prices has no limit
Products on shelves are not fixed
They target things that sells quick
Put on a dollar or two thatÂ’s bullshit.

Chorus repeatÂ…

Phone company pretenders
Tricky bill instigators
Deliberate miscalculators
Start making phone with counters
Warning to cellular makers
Toxic materializers
Useless batteries high numbers
Recycling out the picture
Chorus repeatÂ…
