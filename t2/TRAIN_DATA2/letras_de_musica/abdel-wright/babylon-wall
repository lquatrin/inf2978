Have you ever wondered why you really paying tax
Vague use of the money now it's no surprise attack
Budgeting for the war to come and all the weaponry
Yet unbelievable poverty in your rich country

Chorus

Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall one day
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall one day
Babylon wall will have to fall, Babylon wall
President of your country a coloured will never be
Racial problems why call it the 'land of free'
Pentagon, CIA and KKK the history
Assassination the answer when your system disagrees

Chorus

Speech in Interlude
How long their wall shall stand up firm
With each block that build it has pain, poverty
Greed, starvation, disease,
Yes all of that have to go stop
Crumble to the ground
We have to go break down that
