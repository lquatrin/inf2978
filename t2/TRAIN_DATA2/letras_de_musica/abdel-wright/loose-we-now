How long, how long, how long?
How long, how long, how long?
Talking to the bosses wonÂ’t you listen, donÂ’t delay
Tax out fe kill wee so we want a raise of pay
As we work the money, so boops it gone away
Cost of living sky high, no time to play
Warning to the police force working everyday
Some cops need some serious counseling anyway
Contagious disease called trigger-happy
Bad ma with unu gun, unu fe tek it easy

Chorus
Loose we now, loose we now, loose
Loose we now, loose we now, loose
Loose we now, loose we now, loose
Loose we now, loose we now, loose

How long must we suffer you slave masters
A shackled society.
How long must we suffer you slave masters
A shackled society.
Yes some pointing fingers on you filthy government
You educated thieves of the dollars and cents
Political leaders negative influence
Leggo we country now you non progressive elements
You have some little churches leading people astray
Using name if Christ hiding hypocrisy
How can you say people come follow we?
When deep down you living so indecently

Chorus repeat
