WeÂ’re going down, down, down in quicksand 
Our countryÂ’s law is left in slippery hands 
So many educated yet no solution 
WeÂ’re going down, down, down in quicksand. 
Number one! Purge all police station and 
some headquarters for corruption. 
Two! Some politicians donÂ’t have a clue 
One bag of promise, comfort for a fool. 
Three! Mama canÂ’t pay school fee 
Blood out of stone, education nuh free. 
Four! Ghetto youth with him gun hardcore 
Plan fe mash a works but prison at him door. 

Chorus repeatÂ… 

Number Five! Prisons rehabilitation 
Inmates fe go out and change the nation. 
Six! Government and politics 
People a bawl sey the road want fix. 
Seven! Courthouse flex like the devil 
Pure injustice and the law it no level. 
Eight! Blood shed climb, high rate 
A long time ghetto youth a try hold the faith. 

Chorus repeatÂ… 

Number Nine! Rich man alone want climb 
Inner cities need the resources to shine. 
Ten! What about the homeless them? 
The place them sleep it worse than hog pen. 
Eleven! Me know sey the world it no level 
Tables must turn and the scores soon settle. 
Twelve! Babylon must get melt 
Good over evil, righteous dwell. 
Chorus repeatÂ…
