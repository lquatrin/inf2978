Countless of times when things were rough
And nothing but the heat
Chances of jobs delete I remember well a point in time
I had nowhere to sleep My issues and the streets.
The other day I had my last $30.00 in my empty pockets
I wanted to buy something to eat to kill the hunger
Then I remembered that my guitar needed two stings
That were broken I prefer to feed my soul.

Chorus

How many mountains do we have to climb?
How many rivers of tears to quench the pain?
How long is the journey
It seems so endless
But I have to hold on, hold on.
Religion has been a stumbling block
It haunts me everyday
Will I ever clear this way?
IÂ’m man enough to let you know at times
IÂ’m skeptical of that man called Christ
Even though he gave his life.
How can I survive in a church, a refuge for my soul?
When the livity unfold is different from the word being told
How dare you justify your wicked ways
With quoting from the scripture?
YouÂ’re the better, worse than anything else.

Chorus repeatÂ…

Unfortunately, IÂ’ve been stereotyped
on how to treat a woman
IÂ’m a product of a one night stand
If you happen to be my father
And youÂ’re listening to my song
YouÂ’re damned outright and wrong.
My mom was just a sick woman
She lost her mind at twelve
But you chose to satisfy yourself.
I lost a woman that I truly loved
Although I hardly knew
My anger grew and grew

Chorus repeatÂ…
