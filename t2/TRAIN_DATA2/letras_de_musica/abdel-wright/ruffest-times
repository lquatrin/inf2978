Gold spoon inna mouth, me never get none
More time nothing to eat, not even bread crumb
Drink the water from my eye when it a run down
Quench my emotions.
Confuse, so me tek up all a big gun
Robbing people for needs that is not fun
Babylon jailhouse, think me life done
Five years detention

Chorus
Jah will never give you more than you can bear
ItÂ’s so obvious and itÂ’s crystal clear now
Jah will never leave I lonely
HeÂ’ll take me through the roughest times.
I will trust in the almighty
He will help me to get by
Though the system is all messed up
My meditation is very high
Jah will never leave I lonely
HeÂ’ll take me through the roughest times

Look a work all now me no get none
Me girl a breed and time it a come down
No money, no cash, not a loan sum
Goose over cook and burn
Hypocrites, backbiters, them all come
Gun shot, turf war, mek me all run
Loud noise, siren, dirty cops come
Things take a different turn

Chorus repeatÂ…
