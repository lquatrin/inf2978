Hunger is frequent, canÂ’t find food to eat
CanÂ’t pay the rent, some end up on the street
Them tax we daily, system indiscrete
Responsibilities, ends can hardly meet, hardly meet.

Bridge

We all know that certain things take time
But not forever
Comfort yourself by singing this song of mine.

Chorus
Although the mountain is high
I know that one day I will get by
Although the bridges are low
IÂ’ll take my chances to touch the troubled waters.
Poverty done deya, ItÂ’s a global thing
Crime and violence mek we head start spin
You see the homeless youths them, trust me, what a thing
Exposed to abuses, chances very slim.

Bridge repeatÂ…

Chorus repeatÂ…

Some ghetto youths see no choice but to tek up the gun
Some leave school with diploma yet work them canÂ’t get none
Oh what a thing
You think prison and death row system is such a fun
Think again Suicide to me my view is fire burn, fire burn.

Chorus repeatÂ…

Although the mountain is high
I know that one day I will get by
Although the bridges are low
IÂ’ll take my chances to touch the troubled waters.
Although the mountain is high
I know that one day we will get by
Although the bridges are low
IÂ’ll take my chances to touch the troubled waters
