Here I'm standing around and my heart beats so loud
you are listening to me - hope you're feeling allright
we worked hard - for this moment
to bring our music to you
the idea of good Rock'n Roll
which always fills my soul

The music makes my life go on
I need it babe oh so bad
I think for you it's just the same
cause you are listening here
music is a friend of mine
in all situations of life
when I'm loneley I call Rock'n Roll
it's always by my side
music is emotional

it's not enough when you hear
well, you have to feel it my friend
it takes the way in your soul
music needs no languages
no frontiers not at all
music is a part of my life cause music is so true
