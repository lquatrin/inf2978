Everybody needs someone
everybody's on the run
everybody's looking for
the love, that we need
the love, that we miss

Everywhere is love around
but loneliness is still what I found
everybody's looking for
the love, that we need
the love, that we miss

Where are you tonight
I need your love
I need it to feel right
where are you tonight
I'm missing you by my side
I'm missing the magic of your eyes babe

Tired of those loneley nights
empty streets and darkest lights
everybody's looking for
the love, that we need
the love, that we miss

Everybody needs someone -
and myself I'm still on the run -
searching for - what I lost a long time ago
and I know,
what I need is only you
