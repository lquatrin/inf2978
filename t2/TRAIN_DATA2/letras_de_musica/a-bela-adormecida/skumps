King hubert:]  skumps!

[king stefan:]  skumps!

[king hubert:]  skumps!

[king stefan:]
A toast to this night!

[king hubert:]
The outlook is rosy,

[king stefan:]
But the future is bright,

[both:]
Our children will marry,
Our kingdoms unite,
Skumps! skumps! skumps!

[king stefan:]  skumps!

[king hubert:]  skumps!

[king stefan:]
A toast to the home!

[king hubert:]
One grander by far than a palace in rome!

[king stefan:]
Ah, let me fill up your glass,
That glass was all foam!

[both:]
Skumps! skumps! skumps!
