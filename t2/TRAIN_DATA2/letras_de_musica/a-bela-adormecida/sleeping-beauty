Sleeping beauty fair
Gold of sunshine in your hair
Lips that shame the red, red rose
Dreaming of true love in slumber repose

One day he will come
Riding over the dawn
When you awaken to love's first kiss
Till then, sleeping beauty, sleep on

One day you'll awaken to love's first kiss
Till then, sleeping beauty, sleep on
