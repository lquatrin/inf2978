I can't stand to look at you
You sit there thinking you're so cool
Tight t-shirt, baggy pants
You f*ckers are too scared to dance
The abducted vs. the emo kids
And you're gonna die
You buy into a clique that's cut to fit
And your bands all sound like sh*t
You stupid kids aint got no soul
You can't begin to fathom real
Rock 'n' roll
