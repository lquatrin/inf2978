When i first saw you i knew i'd hate you
Everything you've done i'm not the only one
I can't believe that you're still alive
Nothing going on behind your eyes
Lose the attitude drop the stare
Stop complaining i don't care
Just shut up & go away
Seeing your face f*cks up my day
Nobody wants you around
Whenii first saw you i knew i'd hate you
Everything you've done i'm not the only one
I'm sick of you saying that you're punk
It don't matter how you spike your hair up
Lose the attitude drop the stare
Stop complaining i don't care
Just shut up & go away
Seeing your face f*cks up my day
