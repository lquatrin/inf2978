Well i aint no loser alright
So stay with me tonight
I wanna go around the world
Be my american girl
I like everything about you
What do i gotta do to make you see
You're the one girl for me
I wanna go round the world
With my american girl
You're driving me crazy it's true
And i can't keep my eyes offa you
