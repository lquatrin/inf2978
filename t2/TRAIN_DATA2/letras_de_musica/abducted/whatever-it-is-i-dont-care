you call me up all the time 
  you're just trying to make me cry 
  what the f*ck did i ever do to you 
  for all this sh*t you gotta put me through 
  you think it's funny but the joke's on you 
  i already know what i'm gonna do 
  i don't care i don't care anyway 
  you called me up on the phone 
  told me that you're all alone 
  told me that you're sad i'm gone 
  but i'm the one who's moving on 
  it's stupid it's silly it's so plain to see 
  i no longer want your company 
  you can tell all your friends that you thing i'm lame 
  or you can go die it's all the same 
  you must think you're livin in a tv show 
  what i saw in you baby i don't know 
  you aint breaking my heart 
  but you're making me sick 
  i've heard so much of your sh*t 
  but i don't care don't care what you say 
  you wrote to me the other day 
  feelin bad cause i gone away 
  you know i don't care what you say 
  i know you're useless anyway 
  you don't matter anymore 
  now it's over you're out the door 
  don't come crying to me 
  just go away 
  whatever it is, I DON'T CARE
