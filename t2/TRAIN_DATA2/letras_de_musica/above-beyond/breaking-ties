wrong in places. These are the original correct lyrics.
Oh when the cold wind blows
I feel it to the bone
Oh when you say you know
I feel I am not alone

And even though I may return
To empty places on my own
Where I remember everything you want me to forget.

And you provide a parachute
When I am falling like a stone
And I remember there's a life that I have not lived yet

You and I
Truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I
Breaking ties
How could we be so right and so wrong?


I hear the words you say
Your mouth against my skin
My world just falls away
You light me from within

And even though I may return
To empty places on my own
Where I remember everything you want me to forget.

And you provide a parachute
When I am falling like a stone
And I remember there's a life that I have not lived yet

You and I
Truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I
Breaking ties
How could we be so right and so wrong?

Truth and lies...
Breaking ties...

You and I
Truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I
Breaking ties
How could we be so right and so wrong?
