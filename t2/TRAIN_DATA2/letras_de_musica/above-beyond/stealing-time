I'm stealing time from my own life,
all the hours that God sends,
I'm flying high on my red eye
and winding down the windows.

I'm stealing time from my own life,
all the hours that God sends,
my future is a Valentine,
stolen in the perfect crime.

And as the hours go flashing by,
I'm winding down the windows.
And I know I'm living out of line,
but with a blazing smile I'll die.
