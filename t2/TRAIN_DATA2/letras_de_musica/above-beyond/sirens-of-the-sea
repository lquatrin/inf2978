Follow me, follow me yeah let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea yeah let's go

Out beyond the water's edge
Far out past the coral bench
Underneath the diamond dancing lights
Chase the world from far below
Silence sleeping in the glow
Drifting down into the endless night

Take my hand, take my hand yeah take my hand
Follow me, follow me yeah let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea yeah let's go

Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire to set me free
Let us lie here all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea

I ... can not ... resist ... your call (x4)
