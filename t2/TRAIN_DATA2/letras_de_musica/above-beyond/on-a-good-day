A little bit lost and a little bit lonely
A little bit cold here
A little bit of fear

But I hold on and 
I feel strong And 
I know that 
I can 
I`m getting used to it Lit the fuse to it Like to know who 
I am Been talking to myself forever 

Yeah 
And how 

I wish I knew me better 
Yeah 

Still sitting on the shelf but never 
I never seen the sun shine brighter 
And it feels like me on a good day 
And it feels like me on a good day 

I'm a little bit hand in A little bit isolated 
A little bit hopeful 
A little bit cold But 

I hold on and 
I feel strong And 
I know that 
I can I`m getting used to it Lit the fuse to it Like to know who 
I am Been talking to myself forever 

Yeah 
And how 
I wish 
I knew me better Yeah Still sitting on the shelf but never 
I never seen the sun shine brighter 
And it feels like me on a good day
