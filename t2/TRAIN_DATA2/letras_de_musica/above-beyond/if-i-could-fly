A thousand people on the street
The rain its trying to drown my feet
The cold bite sent to every bone

The solemn faces pass me by
The grave mirror buried smiles
A crowded train to take me home

If i close my eyes a minute
See a world within a minute
standing on the road
my wings to take me high

If i could fly
See the world beneath me
Feels like i dont wanna set free
Oh, if i could fly

A simple smile can change a day
An understanding look and say
I know exactly how u feel

But we have learn to build our walls
so very strong and very tall
for fear of what the world might steal

If i close my eyes a minute
See a world within a minute
standing on the road
my wings to take me high

If i could fly
See the world beneath me
Feels like i dont wanna set free
Oh, if i could fly

If i could fly
See the world beneath me
Feels like i dont wanna set free
Oh, if i could fly
