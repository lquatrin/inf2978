Here I come to find myself Â– catch the tide.
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself feel the tide
I'm all at sea and so unwise

I'm so afraid I lose your love as times goes by
The courage is a fire Â– and a beacon so bright
The sunset builds a memory - our love signed
And all I see becomes a lie

Will I wash away - turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong!
Call a setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home

I close my eyes I know you're there Â– love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I designed
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all I see we say goodbye

Will I wash away - turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong!
Call a setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home
Looking for a place called home

Will I wash away - turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong!
Call a settïng sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home
