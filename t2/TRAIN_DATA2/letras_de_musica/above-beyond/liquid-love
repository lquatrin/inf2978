I wait 4 you my loveÂ…
I ache for you my loveÂ…
Call this a liquid love
Rain down at me

Your love slips thru my hands
These streets like sinkin' sands
Drowning a liquid love
Rain down at me

I call out you name
Your love is chasing thru my veins
Such a foolish game
Your love's no good for me, good for me
But it makes my happy

I wait 4 you my loveÂ…
I ache for you my loveÂ…
Call this a liquid love
Rain down at me

I call out your name
Your love is chasing thru my veins
Such a foolish game
Your love's no good for me, good for me
Then it makes my happy
