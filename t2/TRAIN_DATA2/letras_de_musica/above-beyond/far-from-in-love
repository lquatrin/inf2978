Sailing away from me like melting snow in my hair 
I miss your touch, 
Trying to sew up a love that was built on the sun 
I miss you so much 
Like a fire burns to embers 
I know this is where it ends 
In the ashes we are dying 
almost strangers only friends 

Far from in love x4 

Far from in love (So far from love) 
Far from in love 
Far from in love (So away from love yeah yeah..) 
Far from in love (From all the loving that I knew) 

I can see behind your eyes that youÂ’re afraid of who you are 
Only silence now between us 
IÂ’m amazed weÂ’ve come this far 

Far from in love x4 

Far from in love (So far from love) 
Far from in love 
Far from in love (So away from love yeah yeah..) 
Far from in love (From all the loving that I knew)
