Don't they know that there's something going on
What they're harming with their indecision
But who will be left standing when I'm gone?
There'll be nothing left but a vision

It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It's too easy to bow your head and pray
There are some times when you should try to find your voice
This is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle?
As the ice caps melt away
No use hoping for a miracle
There's a price we'll have to pay

Don't they know there's something they can do?
To be sure of tomorrow's tomorrow
And too late, too late for me and you
No more time left for you to borrow

It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It's too easy to bow your head and pray
There are some times when you should try to find your voice
This is one voice that you must find today

Are you hoping for a miracle?
As the ice caps melt away
No use hoping for a miracle
There's a price we'll have to pay
