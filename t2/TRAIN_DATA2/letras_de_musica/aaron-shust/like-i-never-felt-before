(Been) training all this time
IÂ’m at the starting line
A marathon IÂ’m gonna have to run
In such a way as if to win the prize
And I believe
Even though I canÂ’t see
All the athletes from days gone by
Are in the stadium surrounding me
And in the days
before the final phase
I sacrificed the things that held me down
And concentratedly I fixed my gaze.
A shot resounds
My heart begins to pound
And I begin to know what itÂ’s like
To run as if I had nobody around
And I feel like I never felt before
I ran through the open door
And I feel like I never felt before
And it seems YouÂ’re aware of so much more
Than I gave You credit for
And I feel like I never felt before

Climbing high
I can almost touch the sky
But every time IÂ’m halfway there
I think IÂ’ll never reach the top alive
But IÂ’m aware
IÂ’m safely in Your care
And with Your help IÂ’ll never face a day
That I am unable to bear
You taught me to crawl/ You taught be to stand
You taught me run one step at a time/and watch out for the quicksand
You taught me to live/ You taught me to die
You taught me to spread My wings and how to fly
