One Day I will leave this body 
and I will get a perfect one 
That day I will see His glory 
shining like the noonday sun 
One day, I'll take a walk with Jesus 
He might explain the mysteries of life 
Some say, I just can't believe it 
but I know that one day 

We will gather at the Crystal Throne 
All these years: we1re finally home 
I can actually see His face 
And all I can do is say, 

Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty, 
Who was and is and is to come 
We lay our crowns before You 
Every heart and soul: adore You: 
The God of gods, Almighty One 

One Day, death will be abolished 
And sin will have its mastery no more 
And I know that we will be astonished 
At all that our Creator has in store 
One day we will meet our Savior 
And He will give each one of us a stone 
Engraved with our names upon it: 
known by God alone
