I would leave My world behind
Give up everything thatÂ’s mine
If I could know you
I would leave behind My home
Enter your world all alone
If I could find you
It doesnÂ’t matter if you run away
It doesnÂ’t matter if you hide
I would leave my world far behind
This love inside of Me; itÂ’s never gonna die
And I donÂ’t care how far away you roam
No I donÂ’t care how far away you roam
IÂ’ll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home
IÂ’ll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home
I would love to see our name
Engraved upon a picture frame
On my mantle

I would love to see your face
Every morning as you wake up
To see Me
I just wish that I could talk to you
Because I love you more than life
