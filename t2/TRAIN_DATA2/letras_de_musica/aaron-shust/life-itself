Before the break of dawn
My heart cries out to You
Where IÂ’m surrounded by my night
Here all my weaknesses will wait upon Your mercy
The hope of dawn from black to white
From black to white
I love You more than life itself
Lord, You are so good to me
I need You more with every breath
So wonÂ’t You breathe some life in me
WonÂ’t You breathe some life in me
Awakening the dawn, with all my heart
I sing to You
You are the reaSon that I live
Under me, over, all around I know YouÂ’re with me
Never condemning: You forgive
No matter where I go
No matter where I stand
Your Spirit always speaks to me
And tells me whose I am
With every breath I take
And every choice I make
My heart will always sing to You
