So Hard To Leave
Im finding it so hard to leave tonight im already home and i cant tell you goodnight bitter sweet feelings that break me down when you're around (your around)

And i brought flowers to you again you gave them back and told me were just friends you dont know how much it kills me when i hear those words (say those words)

And i hope that you regret what you've done its like shooting yourselve with your own gun and i hoped and cried that night i walked in your door(into your door)

And the biggest mistakes are the ones you make and i love watching you make excuses for them and the biggest mistakes are the ones we take for granted and i wont be taking again x2

And i hope you burn for the pain you caused and i hope you burn long and hard and i hope you burn for breaking my heart and i hope you burn for the way you are and i hope you burn long and hard and i hope you burn and see how they are

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
awaaawaaa dahaahaaa awaaaawa

and see how they are

(tonight alone nobodys home what kills the stars as we fall you wanted more than you can have but we both wanted all)
