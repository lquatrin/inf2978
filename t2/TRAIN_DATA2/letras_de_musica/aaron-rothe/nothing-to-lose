Close my eyes, exhale your voice from my head. Looking for some truth in the lies that i was fed.
And your thought for poking im alway's choking, but i can wait my turn. And i built these walls to keep from getting burnt
Cant you here me? What else must i say! lost a touch to. Of feelings away,with our sense of reality. Understanding my heart is yours. To take away the pain that day and lies invents and takes away my heart and my chest shaking.Always giving never taking.
If you can see now! My broken face! You'd see im watching your every move. If i can see girl your broken heart now i'd lay right down cause i got nothing to lose.
Hold me now, I can feel you. I am so alone. Let her know deep inside her heart is were she is home.
