And your eyes
You should see the way they glow when you smile
The way your laughter sets the world on fire
I take for granted all the moments that im with you
Im with you

Cuz your beauty takes my breath away
And i love it when im asked to stay
And i'd bring you flowers every day to show you
Its not your make-up or your hair at all
Its the girl underneath it all
That amazes me
And you are
What beautiful is

And i recall
All the times we spent together in the park
Throwing sticks under the bridges not too far
I'd close my eyes and underneath my breath i'd say
I'd say

That your beauty takes my breath away
And i love it when im asked to stay
And i'd bring you flowers every day to show you
Its not your make-up or your hair at all
Its the girl underneath it all
That amazes me
And you are
What beautiful is

Today was long
All i thought about was singin you this song
And how you'd take it if you took it in at all
And i really just want you to understand
To understand

That your beauty takes my breath away
And i love it when im asked to stay
And i'd bring you flowers every day to show you
Its not your make-up or your hair at all
Its the girl underneath it all
That amazes me
And you are
What beautiful is
