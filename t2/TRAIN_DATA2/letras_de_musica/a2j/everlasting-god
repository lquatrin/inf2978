Will never die, but have life everlasting
A young man lost his wife to heaven
Now family and friends have gone
At her closet, he's weeping into empty dresses
Full of memories, every one
And he whispers, "i miss you"
And he tries to remember a promise or two
But he know that it's still true
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him
Will never die but have life, everlasting
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him
Will never die but have life, everlasting
Never die but have life everlasting

O take another ride to town
The driver passes steeples
All day as he's making his rounds
He tries to look away
'cause it reminds him of a brighter day
When his mother taught him to say
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him
Will never die, but have life everlasting
There's an old man mowin' the graveyard
And he stops to wipe his brow
He was trimming around a statue
Of jesus with his arms reaching down
And carved there in stone
Is a bible verse he made his own
Such a long, long time ago
And it said
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him

Will never die, but have life everlasting
A young man lost his wife to heaven
Now family and friends have gone
At her closet, he's weeping into empty dresses
Full of memories, every one
And he whispers, "i miss you"
And he tries to remember a promise or two
But he know that it's still true
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him
Will never die but have life, everlasting
God so loved the world that he gave
Gave his only son
That whosoever believeth on him
Will never die but have life, everlasting
Never die but have life everlasting
