If the wind
is in your heart...
And if that is
the spring wind...
I want to let it blow...
Forever, forever
If the sky
is in your heart...
And if that is
a blue sky...
I want to try and reach it...
As far as it goes, as far as it goes
It's because you are
only laughing all the time...
And then you
only embrace me
If the sea
is in your heart...
And if that is
the sea of tears...
I want to try and swim it...
As long as I like, as long as I like
It's because you are 
only laughing all the time...
And then you
only embrace me
