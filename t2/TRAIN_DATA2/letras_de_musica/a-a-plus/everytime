Lately Im not who I used to be someones
Come and taken me where I dont wanna go
If I knew exactly what I have to
Doin?order to be there for you
When you were feeling low
And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine now,
I know we can revive it all the love we left
Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could
Ever find and I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away save me,
Ive fallen from my destiny
You and I were meant to be
Ive thrown it all away now youre gone
Its time for me to carry on but baby I just
Cant go on without you by my side
And all the things we ever wanted were once yours and mine
Now, I know we can revive it all the love we left
Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever
Find and I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away we
Can survive it all the pain we feel inside
You relied on me and now Ive let you down
Now, I promise you forever
I will be the best I can now, I know
We can revive it all the love we left
Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since I gave your love away
Everytime I kiss I feel your lips and
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away
