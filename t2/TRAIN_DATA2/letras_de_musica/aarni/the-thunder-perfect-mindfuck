I am the unlearned and they can learn from me,
I am shame and I am boldness.
I am the shameless and I am ashamed,
I am knowledge and I am ignorance.
I am falsehood and I am truth,
I am the ruler of my offspring and my power is from them.
Whatever I will happens to me.

What you see outside you, you see inside you,
It's visible and it's your garment.
In my weakness don't forsake me,
Don't be afraid of my power.
I am the knowledge of my inquiry.
I am the one whose image is great
And I am the one who has no image.
I am the first and the last,
I am the utterance of my name.

Nothing is true and everything is permitted in our observer-created universe.
Thought is the sickness of the human mind and knowledge is the reward of action.
Let our every act be towards personal and collective liberation!

Accept nothing, assume nothing.
Always question authority - especially your own.
Matter imprisons the spirit to force it into an effort to free itself.
The instant you speak about a thing, you miss the mark.
Now that I have shed my skin completely,
One true reality alone exists.

Out of the gravity-well of Hiidenvuori rises the crowned
Kundalini DNA fire-serpent to the stars.
Its each mirror-like scale the history of a sentinent species.
Making again for the first time its cosmic trip to the all-source.

Ride the snake.
