Through the land of Tuonela, I make my journey 
To solve the mysteries of the grave, my heart's violent yearning. 
The noisome welkin oozes down raining sour bile 
Like a worm-eaten face full moon shines on bright. 

Interrment is the end of pain, escape from life's nauseous flame. 

Across a field of mouldy grass I ride post and fast 
On a reindeer mummified with the witch-drum last. 
Heading for a citadel built from howling bones, 
Filling this heaving night with dark insane moans. 

Interrment is the end of pain, escape from life's nauseous flame. 

Approaching the castle gate I see its keeper 
He is the blind ape of fate, ancestor of the reaper. 
Hailing from a nearby lake, a monstrous fleshy arrow 
Aimed at our pallid world to kill us in our barrow. 

Internet is the end of pain, escape from life's nameless fane.
