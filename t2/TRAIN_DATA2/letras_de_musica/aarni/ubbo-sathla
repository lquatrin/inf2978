"...For Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before the coming of
Zhothaqquah or Yok-Zothoth or Kthulhut from the stars, Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in
the steaming fens of the newmade Earth: a mass without head or members,
spawning the grey, formless efts of the prime and the grisly prototypes of
terrene life... And all earthly life, it is told, shall go back at last
through the great circle of time to Ubbo-Sathla."
