I saw you on the swings, you were looking at the sky.
Turned around and told me, thereÂ’s one reason why.
YouÂ’re the keeper of youÂ’re dreams, and the dreamer of you sake
What do you dream of when youÂ’re not awake?

I walk with you for hours. You gently helped my hand.
But our loveÂ’s an hourglass.
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand

???????????????, when stories fade away.
The storyÂ’s what it is, like what happened yesterday.
You said it was ok in the middle where we lay.
But then you heard me cry when the hourglass went dry.

I walk with you for hours. You gently helped my hand.
But our loveÂ’s an hourglass.
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand

Well we said weÂ’d keep in touch, so I guaranteed we must,
Gather up the day and let a sandle in the dust.
ItÂ’s just they wonÂ’t let me led, youÂ’re a lady, IÂ’m a gent.
The different ways we went, were the different ways we went

I walk with you for hours. You gently helped my hand.
But our loveÂ’s an hourglass.
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
Let love be the sand
