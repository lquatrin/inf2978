He was thinking like a mad man
He was jealous on his own
And the sooner he figures
That he won't be going home
They left him the front key
Post it in when you go
Gave that man one more chance
To prove that there's no more
I have told you life's a worry and it's true
Your so serious so what is it with you
There never has been
So many rules crossed out in one
You can tell it to yourself
When your the only one having fun
You remember the difference
Your held together my son
And the subtle seggestions
Dropped by everyone
It's a good song for someone
Now who's that going to be
My appetite for soul tonight
Is begging down on me
If it rolls then it rocks
And if you don't push them it stops
If you see the people shouting out
Your allowed to shout out too
I wouldn't ask if you knew
He's not that sure of his charm
One more taste can't be a waste
Not where this one's from
