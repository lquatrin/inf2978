I would like one glass of water
And I would like to dance with your daughter
I would like if you would let me
Take your girl off to the party
I´d bring her home
Your one and only
I´d earn your word
And treat her purely

I´m no king kong
I may be hairy
But don´t get me wrong
I already told her
She can lean on my shoulder
For life, for life
For life

I would like a tree in a garden
That´s big enough for us to climb on
Away from the world and it´s burdens
Forgive me
Up in the leaves
We can be free and happy

I´m no king kong
I may be hairy
But not quite as strong
I already told her
She can lean on my shoulder
For life, for life
For life
