There´s no
Atmosphere
On the moon
Much like the vibe in the room
Cold, closed out
Needs more fuel
Because it´s too damn cool
Like old king cole
He grew too old
Died and didn´t get his wish
To be super rich and forever young

Well that´s one step back

You know he did not go
Without leaving a stitch
To his wife
Who was a saucy dish
You know he owed her money
And that´s sort of funny
With no room to negotiate
Before he passed
The pearly gates
And she made his grave from slate
It´s not even straight
Not even straight

Well that´s one step back
