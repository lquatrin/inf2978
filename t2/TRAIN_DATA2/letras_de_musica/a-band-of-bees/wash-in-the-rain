I try and I fail
Sometimes I even succeed
If you look at my life
I can´t complain
If you know what I mean
And it is all the same
If your holding out you can wash in the rain

Wash in the rain, wash in th rain

I got salt you got pepper
Maybe we could get it together
I dig a hole you fill it up
Your the second thing to knock me over
Only to the waves at the edge of the water

Wash in the waves, wash in the waves

I find it hard to forget
All the effort in regret
Put in one pot that´s big enough
It´s bound to crack when it hits the rock
That ´cause your wicked and you wouldn´t stop
That ´cause your wicked and you wouldn´t stop
