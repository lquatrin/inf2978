How could the one I gave my heart to

break my heart so bad

How could the one who made me happy

make me feel so sad

Won't somebody tell me so I can understand

If you love me how could you hurt me like that

how could the one I gave my world to

throw my world away

how could the one who said I love you

say the things you say

how could the one I was so true to

just tell me lies

how could the one I gave my heart to

break this heart of mine

Tell me



How could you be so cold to me

when I gave you everything

All my love, All I had inside

How could you just walk out the door

How could you not love me anymore

I thought we had forever

I can't understand



How could the one I shared my dreams with

take my dreams from me

How could the love that brought such pleasure

bring such misery

Won't somebody tell me

somebody tell me please

If you love me

How could you do that to me

tell me



How could you just walk out the door

How could you not love me anymore

I thought we had forever

I can't understand



How could the one I gave my heart to

break my heart so bad

How could the one who made me happy

make me feel so sad

Won't somebody tell me

so I can understand

If you love me

How could you hurt me like that

How could the one I gave my world to

throw my world away

How could the one who said I Love You

( you said you love me)

say the things you say

How could the one I was so true to

(yeah u did)just tell me lies

How could the one I gave my heart to,

make me feel so sad,

How could the one I gave my heart to,

break this heart of mine

tell me, ohh tell me....
