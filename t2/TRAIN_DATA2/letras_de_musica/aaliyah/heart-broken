mmm 

hey hey hey



baby baby baby yah

i wanna satisfy you

maybe i try too damn hard, to show you i love you

what made ya go and run this game on me

when i stayed by your side

what made you go and leave?



Chorus

Tired of my heart, being broken (being broken)

Tired of these tears fallin down my face (fallin down my face)

Tired of this love, being taken (oo for granted) for granted

wont cha go away?



you dont know, how i feel

i'm for real

i used to be in love

but not no more

when will you learn that i got feelings too

you never know, until it happens to you..yah



Chorus



There's one thing, i gotta ask of you,if this is true

why you took your love away 

Why you took your love away from me 

There's one thing, i gotta ask of you,if this is true

why you took your love away 

why



Chorus

(repeat until song ends)
