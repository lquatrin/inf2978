How y'all doin out there tonight?

Yes, i love you too

I just wanna talk to the ladies tonight

For all you ladies that done had your heart broken

I done had my heart broken to, so i can relate ya know

So if it's OK with you, i'm just gonna break it down for the fellas,

That don't know that they can't break a womans heart

Alright? So check it out! (uh)



I gave you all of my love, all to you

And you don't appreciate the things that i do

I gave you all of my time, cause you blew my mind

I let you do me wrong, cause love had me so blind



Chorus:

I once was young, but i'm all grown up and,

I'm dumb by love and i used to love you

You tried to play me and then persuede me

I still remember the pain you gave me

I can't believe you, i gotta leave you

I'm packin up and you can hit the road jack

You can take these things that you gave me

Cause i'm never comin back 



All i wanted, was a little love

But you chose to hang out all night with the boys

So what are you saying?

Am i wasting time?

Trying to claim something that's not even mine



Chorus



Why you hurt me? (why you hurt me?)

Why you hurting me so bad?

Gave you my time, you played with my mind

Why you wanna make me sad? (2x)
