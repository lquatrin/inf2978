Try again-Aaliyah



Timbaland's Intro:2X

It's been a long time,

we shouldn't have left you left you,

without a dope beat to step to step to, step to, step to freaky

freaky( baby girl)

Verse 1:

What would you do, to get to me?

What would you say, to have your way?

Would you give up or try again,

If I hesitate to let you in?

Now would you be yourself, or play a role?

Tell all the boys, or keep it low?

If I say no, would you turn away,

Or play me off or would you stay (oooohhh)...



Chorus:

If at first you don't succeed

(first you don't succeed),

then dust yourself off and try again

You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed

(at first you don't succeed)

You can dust it off and try again,

dust yourself off and try again, try again,



Verse 2:

I'm went to you, you went to me,

but I can't let it go, so easily,

Not 'till I see, what this could be,

could be eternally, or just a week,

Now our chemistry, it's off the chain

It's perfect now, but will it change?

This ain't a yes, this ain't a no

So do your thing,

and we'll see how it goes (oooohhh)...



Chorus

If at first you don't succeed

(first you don't succeed),

then dust yourself off and try again

You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed

(at first you don't succeed)

You can dust it off and try again,

dust yourself off and try again, try again,



Bridge:

See you don't wanna throw it all away,

I might be shy on the first date,

but what about the next date (huh, huh, huh, huh)

See you don't wanna throw it all away,

I might be buggin' on the first date but

what about the next date (huh, huh, huh, huh, oh)



Chorus

If at first you don't succeed

(first you don't succeed),

then dust yourself off and try again

You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed

(at first you don't succeed)

You can dust it off and try again,

dust yourself off and try again, try again,again



Timbaland's Outro:

It's been a long time, (long time) shouldn't have left you left you,

without a dope beat to step to step to, step to, step to
