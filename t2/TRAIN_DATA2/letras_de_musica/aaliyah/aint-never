Chorus 2x
I ainÂ’t never had a girl run game like you
AinÂ’t never felt the way I felt about you
AinÂ’t never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk

Thought you was at the mall,
ShoppinÂ’ with your friends
LookinÂ’ for a dress for a wedding you was in
Just the other day,
Stopped in at your work
You wernÂ’t there,
CanÂ’t believe what I heard

She the girl with the long hair? (Yeah thatÂ’s her)
You mean the one that works upstairs? (um hm, yeah thatÂ’s her)
She been seeing my boy Â‘bout three months now (What?)
If thatÂ’s the same girl we talkinÂ’ Â‘bout

Chorus 2x
I ainÂ’t never had a girl run game like you
AinÂ’t never felt the way I felt about you
AinÂ’t never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk

[phone conversation]
Let me hit this girl up.
See what the hell she talkinÂ’ Â‘bout
I know she thereÂ… I know she thereÂ…

(Aaliyah)
Â… Um, Hello?

Boyfriend 1:
Now can you tell me what IÂ’m hearinÂ’ ainÂ’t true,
DonÂ’t want to be a fool for trustinÂ’ you
IÂ’ve givinÂ’ you all that I had to give
So why you want to go on and go do this?

Aaliyah:
Well I donÂ’t know whatchu talkinÂ’ Â‘bout, no no

Boyfriend 1:
No I think you do,
Â‘Cause I got him on the line listeninÂ’ in to you

Boyfriend 2: Wassup?

Bboyfriend 1:
So whatchu gotta say now?
Or do you still say you donÂ’t know what IÂ’m talkinÂ’ Â’bout?

Chorus 2x
I ainÂ’t never had a girl run game like you
AinÂ’t never felt the way I felt about you
AinÂ’t never had to beg,
Nor do I want to start
So if you gonna play me you can walk

Aaliyah:
Now donÂ’t be callinÂ’ me with all this drama you got

Boyfriend 1:
Whatchu talkinÂ’ Â‘bout?

Aaliyah:
And donÂ’t you realize that itÂ’s close to three oÂ’clock?

Boyfriend 1:
It shouldnÂ’t matter now!

Aaliyah:
DidnÂ’t I tell you that IÂ’ll never do you wrong?
And whoÂ’s this kid you got on the phone?

Boyfriend 1:
Ooohh! Whatchu tryinÂ’ to say you donÂ’t know who I am?
When just the other day you was callinÂ’ me your man

Aaliyah:
Well I canÂ’t lie,
I guess itÂ’s time that I, IÂ… (Ooh yeah)
Tell You Both Bye, Bye!
