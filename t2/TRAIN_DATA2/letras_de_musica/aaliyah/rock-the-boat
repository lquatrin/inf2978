Boy you know you make me float

Boy you really get me high

I feel like I'm on dope

'Cause you..

You serve me on a regular (u serve me on a regular)



Boy beat the tied and stroke

Before we drift any deeper (before driften my deeper)

Ready now hold me close

Lets take this over board now

I want you to



CHORUS:

ROCK THE BOAT

Rock the boat

Rock the boat

Rock the boat

WORK IT IN DA MIDDLE

Work the middle

Work the middle

Work the middle

Change positions

New position

New position

New position

Now stroke it for me

Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me



Ooh baby I love your stroke

'Cause you,

'Cause you get me where I'm going

In jury you'll get my vote

'Cause I believe,

I believe you know just

What you doing, now



Baby now we can coast

Let's don't get in a hurry

That's too slow

Go ahead and put

That thang in overdrive now



Repeat Chorus  2x



Stroke it for me

Hmm, stroke it baby stroke it baby

Hmm, work it baby work it baby

Ooh, stroke it

There is something I want you 2 USE...



I want you to use yourself

Like you never ever used it before (NEVER)

To explore my body (explore it baby)

Until you reach the shore (YAA)

I'll be callin' callin' for more (CALLIN)



Repeat Chorus 3x
