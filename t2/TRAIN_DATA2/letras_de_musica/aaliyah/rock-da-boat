Boy you know you make me float

Boy you reallly get me high

I feel like i'm on dope

Cause you

You serve me on a regular

Boy we need to tye this rope

Before we drift any deeper

There now hold me close

Boy let's take this overboard now



I want you to

(Rock the boat)

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

Rock the boat. Rock the boat

(Work it in the middle)

Work the middle, Work the middle

Work the middle, Work the middle

(Change positions for me)

Change positions, New positions

New positions, New positions

(Now stroke it baby)

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me



Ooooh baby I love your stroke

Cause you, cause you get me where i'm going

In a jury you'll get my vote

Cause I believe, I believe you know just what your doing now

Baby now we can coast

Just don't get in a hurry

That's too slow

Go ahead and put that thing in overdrive



I want you to

(Rock the boat)

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

(Work it in the middle)

Work the middle, Work the middle

Work the middle, Work the middle

(Change positions for me)

Change positions, New positions

New positions, New positions

(Now stroke it baby)

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me



I want you to

(Rock the boat)

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

(Work it in the middle)

Work the middle, Work the middle

Work the middle, Work the middle

(Change positions for me)

Change positions, New positions

New positions, New positions

(Now stroke it baby)

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me

Stroke it for me, Stroke it for me



I need you to use yourself

Like you never ever used it before

To explore my body

Until you reach the shore

You'll be calling, Calling for more



(Rock the boat)

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

Rock the boat, Rock the boat

(Work it in the middle)

Work the middle, Work the middle

Work the middle, Work the middle

(Change positions for me)
