Chorus
What if...every guy I saw
What if...sittin' down at the bar
What if...I told him to give me a call
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if...every guy if every guy in the place
What if was all up in my face
What if... what would you say
What if, what if, what if, what if

I hate a jealous man, one who doesn't understand
That i'm attractive so of course men wanna take my hand
And lead me off around the corner, maybe to their place
But when they speak you get mad, jumpin all up in my face

But on the other hand when women come and speak to you
You kiss and hug 'em like its something that you let me do
You're only jealous because you know the ISH you put me through
I might turn right around and do that Ish right back to you

Chorus

I hate a lyin' dude, one who doesn't know the rules
If you goin' cheat burn the reciept from the hotel room
But instead you're up in my face sayin you were at friends
But they all call askin' me where the hell you been

Why do they keep treatin us this way
I guess its a little game we play
We'll burn ya (ohh) We'll cut you (ohh)
We'll kill you (ohh) We don't have to take it no more

Chorus
(Repeat)

Why do they keep treatin' us this way
I guess it's a little game we play
We'll burn ya (ohh), We'll cut you (ohh)
We'll kill you (ohh) We don't have to take it no more

Chorus
(Repeat 3 times)
