Chorus:

If my ladies in the house tonight let me here you say e-ay (hey-e-ay)

If my fellas in the house tonight let me here you see e-ay (hey-e-ay) (2x)



I'm talkin to my ladies, across the world

Are you lookin for a pl-pl-playa?

Tell me what's the word

To the East side, i roll to the West side of town

I came to represent, and show you how i get down



Chorus



Talkin-talkin to my fe-fe-fellas, across the sea

I heard ya lookin for a cu-cu-cutie, so it must be me

I came to party, there's no doubt

Aaliyahs gonna show you how, to turn this mother out



Chorus



Bad Girls (B-B), talkin bout a bad bad girl (B-B)

Ba-Bad girls (B-B), talkin bout a bad bad girl (B-B)



You damn-damn, skip-skippy,

If the track is like paper, i'm garaunteed to rip it,

Smells good here sniff it

I'm lifted, nigga no i ain't also gifted

I'ma let him mix it, hit-hit-hit it

Aaliyah, the L-I-Y-A-H

Step to me mistakably, phatalicious, make 3 wishes

Track-track, dirty like dishes,

Hi-hi hee-hee-hee hi, hee-hee-hee hi, hi-hi-hi
