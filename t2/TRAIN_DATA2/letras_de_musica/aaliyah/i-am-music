[Timbaland]

I'll be with you on your way to work

When your car turns on you'll probably hear me (yeah)

You can't run your car without me (without me)

Want a deal cost you a hundred G's



CHORUS [Static]

I am music

I'm melodies, harmonies

Stereo and mono, on the radio, the radio

I said I am music

Simply dope beats

Intros and drumb rolls, on the radio, the radio



[Static]

I'll meet ya at a summer jam (summer jam)

I'm with you PM or AM

I'll work out with you when you're at the gym (at the gym)

And when you clean the house I'll be in den (coz I am)



CHORUS [Timbaland and Static]

I am music

Melodies, harmonies

Mono, stereo, ohhhhhhhhhhh

I am music

Simply dope beats

Tempos and drumb rolls, ohhhhhhhhh



[Aaliyah]

You may find me at shopping malls

I'm not buying, but I'll be for sale

I'll be your feeling when you talent shows

You might hear me at restaurants (coz I am)



CHORUS [repeat chorus 2]
