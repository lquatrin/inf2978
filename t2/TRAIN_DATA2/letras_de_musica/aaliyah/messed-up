You Don't Say

That I'm Pretty

All These Simple Things

Adding

Up To

Big Ones

There Is Where You Messed Up

Movies

Flowers

Hours

Not Knowing

Where You Are

Or Who You're With

There Is Where You Messed Up



You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother

Better Get Your Act Together

Can't Keep On Holding On

Waiting For You

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up

You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother

Better Get Your Act Together

Can't Keep On Holding On

Waiting For You

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up



I Don't Need Your

Money

No Dinners

I've Got Jewelry

To Win Or

To Lose

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up

You Take Me

For Granted

And Expect Me To

Stay Right Here

And Wait On You

While You Have Your Fun

There Is Where You Messed Up



You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother

Better Get Your Act Together

Can't Keep On Holding On

Waiting For You

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up

You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother

Better Get Your Act Together

Can't Keep On Holding On

Waiting For You

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up



Heading Straight For The Gate

It's Time To Cut My Dead Weight

With You

And Baby That Is Where You Messed Up

I Heard It All Thousand Time

Try To Mess With My Mind

And You

And Baby That Is Where You Messed Up

She Don't Need You Dog

That's Where You Went Wrong

I Don't Need You Dog

See There Is Why You Messed Up

She Don't Need You Dog

That's Where You Went Wrong

She Don't Need You Dog

And There Is Where You Messed Up



You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother

Better Get Your Act Together

Can't Keep On Holding On

Waiting For You

And Baby There Is Where You Messed Up

You Keep On Acting Like

I Really Need A Brother

Man I Don't Need A Brother
