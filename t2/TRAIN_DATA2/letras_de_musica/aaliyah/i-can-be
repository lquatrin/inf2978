Ohhhh no... ohh, oh... mmmm

Oh... ohhhh... ohhh no...



Maybe I'm just wrong for feelin the way I do

Thoughts indecent, want to put those down to you

I know you have a girl, I don't want to tie

When you're free one night to make those hours mine



I can be the other woman in your life

I can be the other reason you're out at night

I can be all the things you thought she might

I can be on the side

That'll alright, alright, alright



Love just ain't my thang, but half of you might be

Enough for two or more, no her to me and me

Fine like expensive wine, drunk off one glass of you

I think more might be too much, so weekends for me are cool



I can be the other woman in your life

I can be the other reason you're out at night

I can be all the things you thought she might

I can be on the side

That'll alright, alright, alright



I can be the other woman in your life

I can be the other reason you're out at night

I can be all the things you thought she might

I can be on the side

That'll alright, alright, alright



Alright, alright, alright, alright....

(repeat until end)
