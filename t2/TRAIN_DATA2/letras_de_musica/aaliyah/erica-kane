[verse:1]
Shes back on the street her fear for night
Feel you with grief she cuts like a knife
Beck you the things that no others could do
She turns a profess into a fool
Oh she aint hard to get the girl gets around
Those that she met their distant to drown
Shell make ya change like you like you never believe
She turns a working man into theif
Oh

[chorus:]
Shes erica erica erica erica
Shes erica erica erica erica
Shes erica erica erica erica
Shes erica erica erica (erica kane)
Shes erica erica erica erica (yo yo)
Shes erica erica erica erica
Shes erica erica erica erica
Shes erica erica erica(erica kane)
Oh back on the block shes at it again
Shell be your friend as long as you spend
I know she torn whole familes apart
She shoot a posion arrow straight threw your heart
Oh this is the day for erica kane
Theres nothing to lose none for her gain
Shell make a honest man steal from his folks
And drain a million man until he go broke

[chorus x2]

[bridge:]
I really dont think you should mess around
Cause all shell do is bring you down
And theres nothing for you to gain
And she goes by this name...

[chorus x2]
