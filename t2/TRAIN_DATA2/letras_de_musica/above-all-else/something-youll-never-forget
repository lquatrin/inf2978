When i look into your eyes (i see),
Something that i couldn't live without,
Even though i haven't lived it for a day.

And if you'll listed to the words i say,
Then this could change the both of us,
For better or worseÂ… i mean it's probably worth a shot.

For you toÂ…
Hush, (hush)
Right now, (right now)
You're gonna hear something you haven't heard
Before, (before)
This time, (this time)
I'll lay it out for you

Just like all those times,
We walked and held hands on the beachÂ…
Oh god, i loved those times,
I'm gonna tell you something you'll never forget
Now hold on beautiful,
I'm not done.
Telling you how much i care
I'm gonna tell you something you'll never forget

What would you do if i had of told you,
Every i said was aÂ…
Lie and i didn't mean a single word that came out of myÂ…
Mouth!

Why does it matter all of a sudden to you?

You should really make up your mind,
And tell me the truthÂ…

Hush, (hush)
Right now, (right now)
You're gonna hear something you haven't heard
Before, (before)
This time, (this time)
I'll lay it out for you

Just like all those times,
We smiled and held hands on the beachÂ…
Oh god, i loved those times,
I'm gonna tell you something you'll never forget
Now hold on beautiful,
IÂ’m not done,
Telling you how much i care,
I'm gonna tell you something you'll never forget (forget)!
