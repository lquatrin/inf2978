I would have said sorry,
But I'm having too much fun with this.
I bet you'd really love me
If I pretended to give a shit.

Yet, you keep on complaining I don't wanna hear it.
Â…The knife's in the kitchen; you know how to use it
I got no interest in hearing your whining
If you wanna backstab then grow a spine!

I'll burn this city, the town's on fire.
Right to the ground, we'll drown it with waterÂ…
These people are gonna dance tonight,
Tonight's our night (Tonight's Our Night!)

And I never want this to endÂ…
Too bad this is out last goodbye, baby don't cryÂ…
I only got one tissue left and I'll be damned if it's wasted on you.

Oh, how the years have passed us by, and no matter how hard I triedÂ…
It took 20 years to open my eyes,
But, I'm ok, I'm alright (Yeah I'm ok, I'm alright!)

I'll burn this city, the town's on fire.
Right to the ground, we'll drown it with waterÂ…
These people are gonna dance tonight,
Tonight's our night (Tonight's Our Night!)

You know I'm right, I know you're wrong! (WHOA-OH-OH)
