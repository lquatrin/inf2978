Hold your breath,
Could I scream for a second.
Cover your ears babe, you don't wanna take in,
Anymore of this than really is needed to make my point to you.

So I gave my all and I asked for nothing,
But soft warm kisses and smiles that meant
Something real to me and even more to you
No one can hear you scream, I can't see right through your

Finger tips, they're reassuring
It's all ok, at least till the morning when
I wake up again and you still wanna leave here
Don't worry baby you're not going nowhere

You're staying right here, at least for now,
I'm just making my entrance, I'm hot on the prowl
Stare eye to eye, you don't wanna miss this
It's the best dam thing that'll ever happenÂ…for usÂ…

If I get my way, these smiles for miles
And broken hearts, will stop right here.
We're gonna make some noise, (something interesting)
We're gonna tear them up, (babe you know what I mean!)

Your hips and eyes remind me of a time,
When everything was alright (Everything's just fine)
You said you'd never say goodbye, but you looked me in the eyes
It's not your choice this time (No, not this time!)

If I get my way, these smiles for miles
And broken hearts, will stop right here.
We're gonna make some noise, (something interesting)
We're gonna tear them up, (babe you know what I mean!)

Could you please hold your breath
Could I scream for a second.
Cover your ears babe, you don't wanna take in,
Anymore of this than really is needed to make my point to you
