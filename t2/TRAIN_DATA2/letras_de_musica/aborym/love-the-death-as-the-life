A religion based on fear 
The bible is not true 
No fear at all-no sin 
Illusion do not need 
Every moment is the last 
To be dead for next time 
Love the death as the life 
Constantness is the right 
Love the death as the life 
Many masters came 
Mostly they were slain 
Every form is different 
Separated one 
Love to be in joy 
Beginning in end 
Don't believe in parents of parents of the parents 
Body spirit soul 
Evil to know more
