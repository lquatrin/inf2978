I reject God 
I deny god 
I reject your world 
I reject your false laws 
I reject your son 
I reject its pathetic life 
I reject your stupid humanity 
I travel over again by now, alone 
the covered roads 
with my brothers 
in the eternal battle 
the eternal struggle against christianity 
in the eternal strife against christianity 
care behind 
tried to the yield 
the resistance aint futile 
meaningless 
aint worthless
