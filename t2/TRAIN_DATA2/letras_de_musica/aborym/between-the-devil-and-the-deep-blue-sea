Between the devil and the deep blue sea] 
Music Nysrok. 
Lyrics M.Fabban, November 2002 

The planet is imploding 
Ashes and death from the bowels 
Dark and hard roar from outside 
Unfaithful are dreaming to see the stars again 

Executioners are dancing 
Proclaiming the cult of suffering 

Corpses are rising 
Disheartened are going mad 
Corpses are rising 
The human pathetic game is over 
Corpses are rising 
Cadavers moves in a mysterious way 
Corpses are rising 
Secrets are burning 

The planet is imploding 
Ashes and death from the bowels 
Dark and hard roar from outside 

Blood is condensing 
Armageddon is coming 
Usque ad finem 
Torment runs rampant 

Through my insides 
Still, numb heart 
Lost, cold soul 
Simply going through 
Physical motions only 
Broken, untended heart 
Battered, dark soul 
Internally I sleep 
Longing to be buried 
Beaten, stopped heart 
Torn, crying soul 
Pains so fierce 
Needing to be put to rest 
No more heart 
No more soul 
My heart to ashes 
My soul to dust 
Unconsciously awake 
I am already dead. 
No hope of salvation
