Destroy the deceit, In the name of the master 
Choke down the false masses 

PRAISE THE BEAST ! 

Accept your destiny, Achieve your revenge 
Your life is the power, Your faith is him 

PRAISE THE BEAST ! 

"In the name of Satan, the ruler of earth, the king of the world 
I command that the forces of darkness, 
To bestow their infernal power, upon me !" 

Worship your spirit, Demolish the cross 
Give the life... and light the fire 

PRAISE THE BEAST ! 

The way you chose, Is built by yourself 
By everything is done, By everything you will 

PRAISE THE BEAST ! 

You are falling into the depth, The depth of your own hell 
Nobody will pull you out, And youÂ’ll die devouring yourself 

PRAISE THE BEAST ! 

Accept the gift, Accept the majesty 
Of the power of darkness, And PRAISE THE BEAST!
