SpiritÂ’s molecules floats in the cosmos 
(while) the dead white man stand upon his burning bed 
Death used its dices one time more and he fucked us all! 
and the gates are open 

SpiritÂ’s molecules floats in the cosmos 
(while) the dead white man stand upon his burning bed 
death used its dices one time more and he fucked us all! 
and the gates are open 

(Cultoculus & M.Fabban chorus) 
Bellum omnium contra omnes 
Bis vincit qui se vincit in victoria 

the Container is empty 
the spirit start to explore the never ending valley 
where the dead-man walking touch the sun 

Strong is the Karnix cry coming from the Vril 
Â… Refugium Peccatorum 
peccatorum! 

Air is dirty.. radioactive and cold 
Millions and millions of candles 
Millions and millions of dead 

echoes from the terrestrial surface 
digital vibes, electric impulses and grey lights 

generated from the earthÂ’s vomit 
and the dead white man is walking 
immortalÂ… downÂ… 
...when illusions lives through its vis logica 
giving back to earth a useless projection 

While the dead white man stand upon his burning bed 
everything is moving down 
in the meanders of the Planet Satan!! 
Good and EvilÂ’s assemblage 
velocity and chaos 
they can combine!!! 

The world is his representation 
the dead white man is not in the world 
the world is inside him.
