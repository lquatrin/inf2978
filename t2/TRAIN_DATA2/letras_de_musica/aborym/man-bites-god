Strong in solitude 
Will, determination 
Ability to tear down 
and rebuild 

No room for doubts 
Beliefs in vain 
Resistance strong as 
as rock solid train 

Obsolete and forgotten 
the godhead of our time 
Heavily tuned down 
No more visible 

Granted with wisdom 
This is me 
The soul is breathing 
cries to be free 

Reflecting upon changes 
Adapting to the new world 
Life coiling like a snake 
like a fathomless lake
