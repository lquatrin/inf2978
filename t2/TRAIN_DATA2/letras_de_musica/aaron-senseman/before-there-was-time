Before there was time, there were visions in Your mind 
There was death in the fall of mankind 
But there was life in salvation's design 
Before there were days, there were nights
I could not see Your face 
But the night could not keep me from grace,
When You came and took my place
			
So I cry holy only begotten 
Son of God Ancient of Days 
I cry holy only begotten 
Son of God and sing the praises 
Of the one who saved me 
And the promises He made 

			
Before there was time You counted the hairs on my head 
You knew all the words I've said 
And You purchased me back from the dead 
Before I was made You searched me and knew my ways 
You numbered all of my days 
And You set forth the steps I would take 
You saved me; You raised me 
You saved me; You pulled me from the grave
