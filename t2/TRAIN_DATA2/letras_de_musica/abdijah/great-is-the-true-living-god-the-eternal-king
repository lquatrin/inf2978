God the blessed and only ruler, 
the King of kings and Lord of lords and God of gods .
Who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light , whom no one has seen or can see. 
To Him be honor and everlasting power and might forever . 
Prise be to the Lord my rock , 
who trains my hands for war , 
my fingers for battle . 
he is my stronghold and my deliverer , 
my shield. 
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ let him be accursed . 
O Lord Jesus come , 
my salvation .Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in undying love. 
This is the true God and eternal life. 
( 1Tym. ,Ps.144, 1 Kor.16 ,22 , Efez.6 24, Jan. 5. 20.)
