thrones were set in place and the ancient of days took his seat, his throne was flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze . 
A river of fire was flowing coming out from before him. 
who of can dwell with the consuming fire? 
who of us can dwell with everlasting burning? 
Thousands upon thousands attended him ten thousands times ten thousand stood before him the court was seated ,and the books were opened . 
Then i continiued to watch becouse if the boast full wards the horn was speaking i keep looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown in the blezing fire. 
One like a son of man , coming with the cloud of heaven .he approached the Ancient of days and was led into his presence. He was given authority , glory and soveregin power: all people , nations and men of every language worshiped him. 
His dominion is an everlasting dominion that not passaway, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
