You neeed to grow up too soon,
My friends say you're a geek, oh yeah
One day in your life you'll be found,
Crying, crying, crying.....(x4)

Chorus:
You're a Loser! A freak and you know its true!
I may love you but why don't love me?
Just why?why?


Why won't you join me again?

I'm so sorry I mistreated you,
One day I'll make up for it,
I promise.promise.promise.
Why are you so hard?Why?
