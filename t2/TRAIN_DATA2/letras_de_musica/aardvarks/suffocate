Chorus:

Go. Your here again your here again so - go.
you don't even like us no you don't so - leave.
and go back I suffocate. your taking up my air.

Verse:

To all the people that left, to those who don't care.
To the bitches that go, who don't even know were there.
Why do you go to the show it the front row looking let 
the real fans up I'm sick of you fucks taking up my air.

I suffocate! 

Chorus

Verse:

To all the preppy bitches, to all the selfish guys
you judge us by us and your ears don't hear the music
you sit there complain about the noise what did you
expect the backstreet boys? your taking up my air.
I suffocate! I suffocate!

Chorus
