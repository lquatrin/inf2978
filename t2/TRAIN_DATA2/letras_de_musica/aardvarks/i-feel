My day is past
The night is here
Another time to give in, to the unending cycle
My muscles and bones... want to give in
my mind and ideas... scatter to not be lost
this tired face wants no bull from
annoying flies that go over my head
My day is past
The night is here
another time to give in, to the unending cycle
Since there is no one... at my side
I might as well sleep into loneliness
these cold summer night streets seem to be my friend
My day is past
The night is here
another time to give in, to the unending cycle
With the tunes of my stereo...
the melodies assure my feelings...
of complete unlike what I am of the day.
But its pure how I feel. I can't give it up.
It is unlike what I am existing.
Lighted telephone polls make me dialated.
Darkness... is this feeling so... let my shadows put me away...
to the hidden place... where I may stray alone.
Just be near there is an... accompanyment... from the prescence of being...
Don't let me rest, don't let me...
Don't let me tire, don't let me sleep...
I feel...
