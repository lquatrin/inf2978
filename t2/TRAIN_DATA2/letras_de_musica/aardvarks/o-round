Living in blind superstition 
fearing malignant unknown 
former believe old tradition 
faces behind the mask 
tribute to natures renewal 
wishing for better times 
it used to make sense to our fathers 
but what is its sense today 
Â— 
repulse the frost 
dispell your sorrow 
welcome the spring 
drink untill you smile 
Â— 
Merry-go-round, merry-go-round 
merry-go-round, merry going round 
Â— 
ItÂ’s time that I put on my make up 
I wonÂ’t be myself for tonight 
I tell the clown in me to wake up 
if he wonÂ’t I drink to smile 
Â— 
repulse the frost 
dispell your sorrow 
welcome the spring 
drink until you smile
