The light hits your lips, it shines on me,
it blinds me. Your beauty is gold and stuns me,
I'm on hold.
And I praise you like a garden
You got the eyes and your dark clothes
I need to feel you, I have to fuck you
I want to suck on your black lipstick.
When our eyes connect, by my focus, and I'm gone.
Inside your soul, it is so cold and I'm frozen to death.
And I praise you like a garden
You got the eyes and your dark clothes
I need to feel you, I have to fuck you
I want to suck on your black lipstick.
The way you move. And the way you smile.
It puts me out. You love your lipstick.
and I praise you like a garden
You got the eyes and your dark clothes
I need to feel you, I have to fuck you
I want to suck on your black lipstick
Stare.... I'm in a deep sleep...
I'm in a deep sleep for you...
