I'm kinda sick Mama
Kinda down
Truck of trouble child
Be what I found
And as I turn
To get away
Another spoken problem done
Got something to say

Lord, I gotta find my home
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own
I'm just tired
Mama tired of runnin' alone
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own

Ain't got no time
No time to think
Search me some gold child
Grab me a drink
Got's me a frown
Need to find a smile
Whether your grass is green or blue child
I'll walk the smile

Lord, I gotta find my home
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own
I'm just tired
Mama tired of runnin' alone
I need a lovin' woman
I can call my own
