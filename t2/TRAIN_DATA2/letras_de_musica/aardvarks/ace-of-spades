If you like to gamble, i tell you i'm your man 
you win some, lose some, it's all the same to me 
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say 
I don't share your greed, the only card i need is 
the ace of spades 
the ace of spades 
Playin' for the high one, dancin' with the devil 
going with the flow, it's all a game to me 
7 or 11, snake eyes watching you 
Double up or quit, double stake or split 
the ace of spades 
the ace of spades 
You know i'm born to lose 
and gamblin's is for fools 
but that's the way i like it baby 
i don't want to live forever 
and don't forget the joker 
Pushing up the ante, i know you got to see me 
read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again 
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die 
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be 
the ace of spades 
the ace of spades
