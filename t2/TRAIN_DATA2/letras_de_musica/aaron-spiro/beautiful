Chorus

Bridge:
You speak for those who cannot speak
You are mercy to the poor and needy
YouÂ’re the bright morning star
YouÂ’re the sacrificial offering
The renewer of the mind
YouÂ’re the peace be still and Know
You saved this soul of mine
YouÂ’re the master the maker the sculptor

Majestic and powerful
YouÂ’re the radiance of GodÂ’s glory
YouÂ’re the final word from God to man
The laughter the poetry the plan
YouÂ’re the dove of peace
Lover of a sinner
You are beautiful, you are beautiful
Jesus you are oh so beautiful
You are beautiful
