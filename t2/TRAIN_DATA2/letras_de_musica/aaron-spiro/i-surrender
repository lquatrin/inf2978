Enough of the fighting
Day after day 
IÂ’ve hit the wall
Trying to live my way
IÂ’ve been running 
IÂ’m wearing thin
This is where I stop
And where you begin

Chorus
I surrender
I lie down
I give up
Enough of the bleeding
My chest hurts
From all this digging

Under my dirt
IÂ’m in a struggle
Tearing me apart
Is this just madness? 
Or the changing of my heart?

Chorus

Bridge:
Into your arms I crumble
Into your arms I crawl
Into your arms I stumble
Letting go you catch my fall
