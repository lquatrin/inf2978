Pray for the kingdom come
For his will be done
Even when you donÂ’t feel a thing
Seek, seek the throne of grace
Time to see and taste 
The sweetness of the king of peace

Chorus
Pray like breathing
When youÂ’re sleeping
Pray for meaning (without ceasing)
When you work
In everything pray like breathing
In everything pray like breathing

Pray like breathing
Pray when your feeling fine
When you feel like your losing your mind
Either way turn to him and pray
Pray every moment of the day
Live in this new way
Speak the truth and tell him what you think and feel
