Forever and ever we will sing your praises
Forever and ever we will glorify your name 
Above all names every name
Merciful Lord Jesus
You took the cross to free us
Conquered death and sin

In a battle they could never win 
For you are the first the last 
Lord of future Lord of past
You reign in glory as the king
You are worthy so worthy
You reign in glory as the king 
Receive the praise we sing
