Time has come
Time is now
To break away from
From the crowd
Rise up, be strong 
Come along

Chorus
We will run, never stop
Till weÂ’ve given all weÂ’ve got
Through the fields through the fire
Till we hit the final wire
By His power we will make it

We will be there
We will be there
When you fall down
Think youÂ’re through
And sin has taken 
The best of you
Fall into grace and rise a new

Chorus

We will sing this melody 
Till we stand in victory
We will love we will give
We will run and we will live
