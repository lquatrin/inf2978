[Â“In your light we see light.Â” Psalm 36:9]
in your light we see the light
in your touch we learn to touch
in your life we are alive
in your love we learn to love

Chorus
all that I know of true
begins and ends in you
let everything I do
begin and end in you

in your peace we find our peace
in your strength we learn to stand
in your arms we find release
in your hands we are your hands
