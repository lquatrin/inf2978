Join with all the angels let creation sing
Glory to our maker, hear the anthem ring
Wise men sing about it young men love to shout it
Everyone everywhere, join in the heaven song 

Chorus
Will you Sing, Sing
Let everyone 
In every tongue
Sing
Let every cup 
Be lifted up 
Sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing

Join with every nation every color every race
Lifting up the chorus too the God of grace
LetÂ’s sing about the story of ChristÂ’s reigning glory
Everyone sing along, join in the heaven song

ChorusÂ’s

Bridge:
Sing in the spirit filled with the truth
Sing like there is nothing else you can do
Sing like a heart found in a dream 
On an outbound train picking up steam
Headed toward the speed of like and following the way
