A girl wishes for
Eternal happiness
Where did she hear
That flute from?
Pi~hyara 
If you cry a neverending rain of tears
I'll give you a Teru Teru Bouzu
If it's a lonely night and you want to meet up
Let's meet in our dreams

That child and that child too, pi~hyarara
They will get along
This time, that time, whenever the time
It can be done cheerfully

A girl wishes for
Eternal happiness
Where did she hear
That flute from?
Pi~hyara 

If it's a casual form of love
Let's send it in a letter, at least
If it's an embarrassing flame inside your heart
Well, I like that too

Carry your happiness, pi~hyarara
We can do it enjoyably
That place, this place, wherever the place
We can get along

Carry your happiness, pi~hyarara
We can do it enjoyably
That place, this place, wherever the place
We can get along
