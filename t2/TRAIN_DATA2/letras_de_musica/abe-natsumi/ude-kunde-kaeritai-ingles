I wanna see you
Tomorrow again
But I'm waiting for you
To say it 
You hate getting clingy
But hey, it's okay if I link arms with you, right?
Just until I get home...

What an uneventful day off
But it's been a few days since I've seen you

I didn't see the movie at all
I just stared at the side of your face the whole time
Looks like I love you, love you too much

As soon as I get home
The first thing I do is send you an e-mail
I call you one more time
Right before I go to bed

You hate long phone calls
So I only want to talk for 5 minutes
Just until I go to bed...

Even if you're shy in front of people
You're very wild when we go karaoke

By turning my cell phone off
No one can bother me anymore
I love you so much it's crazy

Even now, I love you so much
That I feel like I'm gonna cry
Stay by my side, stay by my side
Don't leave me

I wanna see you
Tomorrow again
But I'm waiting for you
To say it 
You hate getting clingy
But hey, it's okay if I link arms with you, right?
Just until I get home...
