Though I want to know the truth
I can't bear to hear it 
As if on purpose, when we meet out
You come late

Hey, what kind of sign is this?
It's dragging me down...

As always, the evening sky
has on a face as if nothing is wrong

Less phone calls, less mail too
Even fewer long phone conversations

Our conversations are full of your
last-minute cancellations, or "because of work"

But it's okay if I believe you, right?
Because we made a promise, after all...

Don't want to make you say those last words
So I put on the face of an obedient child

Why...
Does it require so much courage
To hear the truth?
Today instead of tomorrow
Tomorrow instead of today
It just gets harder and harder to hear
Oh. The evening sky laughed again...

As always, the evening sky
acts as if nothing is wrong...

Don't want to make you say those last words
So I put on the face of an obedient child
