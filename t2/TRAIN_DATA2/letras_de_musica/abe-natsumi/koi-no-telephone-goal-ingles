Bashful, your smile is a diamond
Bashful, you hide it in the twilight
Love's ring-a-ling ring-a-ling telephone call! 
I've been in a romantic mood before
Seems a bit different this time
A good miscalculation of these plans

"Besame mucho tonight
I'm all yours"
I could never say those words

But I won't give up
A miracle pass that's known as enthusiasm
So I'm gonna call you tonight

Besame mucho gently
Love with you is a good job
Besame mucho on the telephone too
The stage of limitless dreams
Love's ring-a-ling ring-a-ling telephone call!

In my school days
I fell in love with ease
Why am I stalling now?

When you laugh, I see your white teeth
Just can't hate a guy like you
You're a girl's enemy -- like cake

But I'll make my mark
I'll get your smiles, the golden shot!
Let's talk for two hours tonight

It's bright, isn't it bright?
This love is quite bright
Bashful, your smile is a diamond
Bashful, you hide it in the twilight
Love's ring-a-ling ring-a-ling telephone call!

Besame mucho gently
Love with you is a good job
Besame mucho on the telephone too
The stage of limitless dreams
Love's ring-a-ling ring-a-ling telephone call!

It's bright, isn't it bright?
This love is quite bright
Bashful, your smile is a diamond
Bashful, you hide it in the twilight
Love's ring-a-ling ring-a-ling telephone call!
