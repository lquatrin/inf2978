The bright light
Is in place of an alarm clock
It wakes up
The napping girl 
The southern sea and sky
I'm full of feelings
For some reason
I want to eat some corn!

Blue sky
The beautiful wind
Plays innocently with my hair
Blue sky
Place your feelings
On this wind, carry it away...

The sweet scent
Along with the sound of the waves
Gives courage to
The napping girl

If I keep watching
The south's white clouds
It definitely seems to be suggesting
Corn!

Blue sky
The breezy wind
Whispers inside my heart
Blue sky
Surely it will carry
Those feelings all the way to the waves...

Blue sky
The beautiful wind
Plays innocently with my hair
Blue sky
Place your feelings
On this wind, carry it away...

Blue sky
The breezy wind
Whispers inside my heart
Blue sky
Surely it will carry
Those feelings all the way to the waves...

Blue sky
The breezy wind
Whispers inside my heart
Blue sky
Surely it will carry
Those feelings all the way to the waves...

Blue sky
La la la...
La la la...

Blue sky
La la la...
La la la...

Blue sky
La la la...
