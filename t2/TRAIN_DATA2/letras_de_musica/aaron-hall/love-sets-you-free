When peeps give you love
Theres nothing in this world that can set u free
Yeah, feel me, yo G hit me

Here I am, all alone
Cant let them get the best of me
(Gotta let you know, love sets you free)
And these walls closing in
Closing in slowly
But aint no way they can hold me down
I wont allow it
Cause I believe, I believe that love yeah, yeah
Love sets you free
You know it will take you higher, oh yeah
If you believe
(KP to the bridge)

Break the darkness in my life like sunshine
Now I believe, now I believe that love

Only love can set you free
Let it be, everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe
Open up let it in
If you change everything will be
Love is blind love is sweet
If you only trust in me
Only love can set you free
Let it be, everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe
Open up let it in
If you change everything will be
Love is blind love is sweet
If you only trust in me
Just believe, love will set you free
