Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Ive got something i
Need to talk to you about
Dealin with your relationship
And the things you do


See, what i cant understand, uh
Is how you call yourself a man
When you dont treat your women right
And you think everything is cool


How you gonna set up a date with her
And just stand her up and try
To come up the right excuse why
Till she tells in your lie


She dont even tell you about when
You do things to hurt her feelings
All she does is hold it inside
Then she calls me up and cries


Even though (even though)
You may not think so
She really cares for you
And will be there for you (ooh, ooh)


But even though (even though)
She may not say so
If you dont get it together (together)
Shell look for someone better


I dont wanna make it seem like
Im just checkin up on you
But is she decides to leave
I promise youll be questionin in me


Askin me where she at and
If she found another man and
If i try to get her back
Will she be willin to give me another chance, yeah


Now if you was handlin business
You wouldnt have to worry about this
And you and i wouldnt even
Be havin this talk right now


I dont care what you gotta say or do
So make it better cause i know that you
Know that i know
That she aint someone you want to lose


Even though (even though)
You may not think so (no)
She really cares for you (she cares for you, oh)
And will be there for you (there for you)


But even though (even though)
She may not say so (she may not say so)
If you dont get it together (get it together)
Shell look for someone better (yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, oh)


So what im sayin, just stop playin
And make sure you treat her right
If you dont shell be gone
And youll be the reason why


If you love her then you better
Find some way to let her know
Cause i would hate to have to be the one
To say i told you so


Even though {oh, yeah}
You may not think so {yeah, yeah,, yeah}
She really cares for you
And will be there for you (said even though)


But even though
She may not say so (she may not say so)
If you dont get it together (get it together)
Shell look for someone better (damn, even though)


Even though (yeah)
You may not think so (may not think so)
She really cares for you (she cares for you)
And will be there for you (and there for you, yeah,
Yeah)


But even though
She may not say so (she may not say so)
If you dont get it together (get it together)
Shell look for someone better (someone better)
