Winter bleeds into spring,
And i don't remember anything,
So someone tell me who won,
The civil war that ran inside my head

Get dressed for empty gestures and wait,
This is the moment we escape

There're shapes on my skyline,
I tried hard, i tried hard to define,
But i guess i've never understood,
We're sleeping on this wasteground once again

Get dressed for empty gestures and wait,
This is the moment we escape

I guess i just had to say
What everyone wants to say
But no-one will ever say

Yeah, we escape,
Through slipstreams and a-z's,
Ten steps on how to live,
Kinetic and fool-proof

This is the moment we escape

I guess i just had to say
What everyone wants to say
But no-one will ever say

Yeah, we escape,
Through slipstreams and a-z's,
Ten steps on how to live,
Kinetic and fool-proof
