See what you've forgone,
Now all hope's withdrawn,
Scratch your face from the mirror - until it's gone,
Ascertain the facts,
Filter stillborn acts,
A smokescreen of denial;
You will surely crack

Oh, do angels rate your progress?
Oh, you're sanitised and hopeless

Did you trade heart and soul in for self control?
Desire to conform took a heavey toll.
Now you're 10% of what you want to be,
But there's safety in these numbers, can't you see?

Oh, do angels rate your progress?
Oh, you're sanitised and hopeless

Oh, do angels rate your progress?
Oh you're sanitised and hopeless

This is not progress.
This is not progress.
This is not progress.
