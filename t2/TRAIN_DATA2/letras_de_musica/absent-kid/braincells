Slept through a storm last night and woke up by your side,
They say I need you more than I know

I see you drink girl, it's really no excuse,
I called my friends to come and cut me loose

Maybe she's bored of me,
Maybe she's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot,
Maybe she's bored of me,
Maybe she's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot

I stole the batteries from her bedroom smoke alarm,
She's gonna miss me and all my charm

I see you drink, girl, it's really no excuse,
I called my friends to come and cut me loose,

Maybe she's bored of me,
Maybe she's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot,
Maybe she's bored of me,
Maybe she's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot

So watch me walk the streets now - on my own instead,
You're air-brushed out of the history in my head,
'Cos I'm not the one,
No, I'm not the one,
I'm not the one,
Who let you down

Maybe she's bored of me,
Maybe she's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot,
It maybe hereditary,
Maybe it's not,
I know that she writes down the things I forgot,
But I'm not the one,
No, I'm not the one,
Well, I'm not the one,
Who let you down
