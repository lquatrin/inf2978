The songs you sing are no good to me,
They never help our cause,,
There's a whole world outside of this room,
So bolt up all the doors

It seems to me that people make you more alone,
For once it almost felt as if we'd made it home

The wrong approach will get you nowhere,
This much is for sure,
But after the fall there comes a sweetness,
That's meant for us all

It seems to me that people make just make you more alone,
(I'm not running away),
For once it almost felt as if we'd made it home

It seems to me that people make just make you more alone,
(I'm not running away),
For once it almost felt as if we'd gone and made it home
