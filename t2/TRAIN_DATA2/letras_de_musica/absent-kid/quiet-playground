The moment came, its been and gone,
Don't hold your breath still for the sun,
I've been a tourist for too long,
It's time to find a place called home

The quiet playground's been reserved,
For those of us who wont be heard,
Shout it out - no response,
Please don't all talk at once

I followed footprints in the snow,
They did not show the way to go,
I carved your name into a tree,
Though you never meant that much to me

The quiet playground's been reserved,
For those of us who wont be heard,
Shout it out - no response,
Please don't all talk at once

The quiet playground's been reserved,

Shout it out - No response,
Please don't all talk at once,
Shout it out - No response,
Please don't all talk at once
