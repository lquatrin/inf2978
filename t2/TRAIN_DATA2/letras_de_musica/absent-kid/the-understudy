Freeze, Tonight I know I will,
When I see how well you're living,
Just hold the camera still

You, You look past me and smile
Just roll a cigarette,
I know it's been a while

These days your lips just seem so dry,
Your cheeks just seem so pale,
I often wondered why

Now you've made your views quite clear,
And I can't condone my actions,
But I guess we have to live with them

But now I've figured you out,
And I wont be sucked back in,
The understudy wins

But now I've figured you out,
And I wont be sucked back in,
The understudy wins
