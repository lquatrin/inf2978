You found a globe,
There's places on it you could go,
When you've returned,
There'll be things that you still won't know

You wandered home,
Under streetlights, kicking stones,
You made it home,
But how long is it safe inside?

Throw your scrapbook on the fire,
It never made much sense,
Take your cuttings from the wall,
Before you lose it all

The torchlight,
The worst part - It's not like you to lose heart,
The torchlight,
The worst part - It's not like you to lose heart

You wandered home,
Under streetlight, kicking stones,
You made it home,
But how long is it safe inside?

Throw your scrapbook on the fire,
It never made much sense,
Take your cuttings from the wall,
Before you lose it all

The torchlight,
The worst part - It's not like you to lose heart,
The torchlight,
The worst part - It's not like you to lose heart,
It's not like you to lose heart
It's not like you to lose heart
No, it's not like you to lose heart
