The morning news left my confused today,
Communications faded fast,
The ground will sink beneath my feet tonight,
Paracetamol won't last

But every song I ever wrote was meant to wind you up,
And every word I ever wrote was untrue,
Now you know

Every wave that hits the shore,
Washes away what was there before,
The hum of machines through the night,
Mean you won't sleep,
No, you won't sleep

The radio drowns out my thoughts tonight,
I know another year has passed,
I had to go there for the millionth time,
I promise this time it's the last

But every song I ever wrote was meant to wind you up,
And every word I ever wrote was untrue,
Now you know

Every wave that hits the shore,
Washes away what was there before,
The hum of machines through the night,
Mean you won't sleep, you won't sleep,
No, you won't sleep

Cos, every wave that hits the shore,
Washes away what was there before,
The hum of machines through the night,
Mean you won't sleep,
No, you won't sleep
No, you won't sleep
No, you won't sleep
No you won't sleep
