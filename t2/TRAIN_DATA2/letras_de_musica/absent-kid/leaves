The leaves on the trees might fall,
But I'll be standing firm,
I tried to make some sense of it all,
But I've got a lot to learn

I never got your letters,
You promised me you'd write,
I never got what you said,
That night

The grass was longer than usual,
As I walked to your home,
This was the most crucial,
Of all the stones I've thrown

I never got your letters,
And you promised me you'd write,
I never got what you meant,
That night

I never got your letters,
And you promised me you'd write,
I never got what you meant,
That night,
That night,
That night
