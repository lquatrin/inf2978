I chanced a smile at your, your disposition,
You glanced through me, me and my best intentions,
You're shedding friends like skin, the skin that keeps you warm,
To exist though, is more, it's more, it's more than just being born

You need a holiday

There's nausea on the airwaves everyday,
The world might want us to stop but we're okay

In a disused hospital i made a film for you,
It reflects, rejects all the shit we do

You need a holiday

There's nausea on the airwaves everyday,
The world might want us to stop but we're okay

The faster you walk, the sooner this will end,
The pitchforks and the lanterns are out my friend,
So dust of all these riot shields and wait,
'cos love is just in videos we hate

There's nausea on the airwaves everyday,
The world might want us to stop but we're okay,
The faster you walk, the sooner this will end,
The pitchforks and the lanterns are out my friend
