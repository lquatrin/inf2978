I saw lights, lights up ahead of me,
Now I see you light up instead of me,
Turn down, turn down the TV,
Turn down and spurn your identity

Chalklines on the floor (I don't see them),
Notes under the door (I don't read them)

I burnt down the family business,
Walked off into the distance,
Gonna start a new life today,
Gonna start a new life today

All of this was yours (I don't want it),
All these shattered dreams (I can't help it)

All, all through your childhood,
You clung to nothing - nothing at all
Now, my stride is broken,
Been through these motions,
You sing;
No! No! I won't go there!

Head in hands, the wreckage still smoking,
The neighbours will not stop talking,
Until the whole damn town knows,
Until the whole damn town knows

Slurring wedding vows (you're out of focus),
Is no use to us now (We're out of focus)

3am - the subway's freezing,
Voices echo, billboards are bleeding,
Left all possessions behind now,
Left all possessions behind now

All of this was yours (I don't want it),
All these shattered dreams (I can't help it)

All, all through your childhood,
You clung to nothing - nothing at all
Now, my stride is broken,
Been through these motions,
You sing;
No! No! I won't go there!

All, all through your childhood,
You clung to nothing - nothing at all
Now, my stride is broken,
Been through these motions,
You sing;
No! No! I won't go there!
No! No! I won't go there!
No! No! I won't go there!
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
