They're the silent soldiers,
Rusty charms and exposed wires,
They're our adversaries,
Wasters rock the fore-front now

Static soul, static soul,
There are no thoughts in my head,
There are no thoughts in my head,
Indecision reigns supreme

Hope was lost in transit,
I scribbled all these answers on the back of my hand,
There'll be no binary sunset,
You were all built to meet demand,

Static soul, static soul,
There are no thoughts in my head,
There are no thoughts in my head,
Indecision reigns supreme

Static soul, static soul,
There are no thoughts in my head,
There are no thoughts in my head,
Indecision reigns supreme

On the coast, on the coast,
No there's nothing here to see,
No there's nothing here to see,
No there's nothing here for me

Our little hearts,
Our brittle bones,
Our simple homes,

Our little hearts,
Our brittle bones,
Our simple homes
