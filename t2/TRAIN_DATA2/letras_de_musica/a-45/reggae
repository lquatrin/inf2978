When i hear a reggae song
My heart begins to sing
The rhyth'm makes my body move
My soul begins to swing
But remember what this music really means
It is the power of the poor
A weapon against their fear

People are down, my love
I see the tears are rolling down their faces
People are down, my love
But reggae is a stuff
Which sets you up

Reggae is so wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But it's also powerful
It is no toy
Reggae, that is energy, for the freedom now
And it fights for human rights
As everyone should do
