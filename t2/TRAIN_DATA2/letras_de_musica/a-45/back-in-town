A 45 - back in town
Whenever i hear just the sound of guitars
Floating all over the world
It's rollin' and tumblin'
All people assembling
The beat of my heart and the sound of the drums
Wake up boys and girls leave your home tonight
Rock is our life the stage is our home
So come all together and have a good time
Let's have a party tonight
With dancing and singing
Romancin' and swinging
The sound of the beat is the pulse in my venes
- all night long
