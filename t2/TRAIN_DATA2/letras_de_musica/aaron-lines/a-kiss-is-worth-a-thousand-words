She said 'I don't even know you anymore 
We're barely friends; we used to be lovers 
I remember when I was all that you were living for 
Now we're just living in this house, like strangers 

I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted 
To make this house a home 
You still lay next to me, but all I feel is alone 
How can I make you see that 

A kiss is worth a thousand words 
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses 
Can't change the way I miss being reassured 
When you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mine 
If you really wanna tell me that you love me 
Want your feelings to be heard 
A kiss is worth a thousand words' 

He just sat there on the couch, looking surprised 
He couldn't believe what he was hearing 
It was like she'd opened up his heart and reached inside 
And told him everything that he was feeling 

He said 'I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted 
Been working day and night 
I felt this distance too 
But I never knew just what to say 
To make it right, til you said 

A kiss is worth a thousand words 
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses 
Can't change the way I miss being reassured 
When you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mine 
If you really wanna tell me that you love me 
Want your feelings to be heard 
A kiss is worth a thousand words' 

In the middle of the night 
They finally got it right 
They both closed their eyes and talked for hours 
He told her that he loved her 
That he couldn't live without her 
Not a single heart was broken 
Not a single word was spoken 

Ooh yeah... just one kiss 
One single kiss, whoa 

A kiss is worth a thousand words 
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses 
Can't change the way I miss being reassured 
When you'd hold me close, look into my eyes, and press your lips to mine 
If you really wanna tell me that you love me 
Want your feelings to be heard 
Yeah, if you really want to tell someone you love them 
Want your feelings to be heard 
A kiss is worth a thousand words
