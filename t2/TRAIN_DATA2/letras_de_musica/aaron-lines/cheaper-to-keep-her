Your down on your luck.
You just lost your truck.
You cant afford another beer.
Your credit cards donÂ’t work.
Whole world thinks youÂ’re a jerk.
You wondering how you wound up here.

It wouldnÂ’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnÂ’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldnÂ’t been cheaper to keep her around

Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so

It wouldnÂ’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnÂ’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around

So if youÂ’re thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
SheÂ’s gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose and when her lawyer gets through with you youÂ’ll have to move to
Mexico.

It wouldnÂ’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldnÂ’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living with an empty bank account

It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
