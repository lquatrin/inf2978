It's way too easy to live this life with your eyes half closed and don't I know.
I spend half my time bored out of my mind sleepwalking.
Well I wake up to this fools parade and I watch the leaves fall down.
I see everything changin' but somehow i feel caged in, just hanging around.

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to set me free, 
out of the ordinary come and rescue me, ya I could use a little love
love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical 
i'm waitin on the wonderful.

It's that feeling that's hard to explain 
when the world's so big and your so small 
and you get caught up in the wonder of it all that's what I miss. 
I saw that look today on a young kids face 
eating icecream at the laudrymat well if you'd asked
him it was christmas again I want to get that back.

I'm waitin on the wonderful, Something to believe,out of the ordinary, 
taste of something sweet,ya I could use a little
love love love to send me a sign i'm tired of the typical I'm waitin on the wonderful.

Ya,ya i'm waitin the the wonderful.I know its out there.

I'm waiton on the wonderful a little something to believe 
out of the ordinary come and rescue me I could use a little love
love love to send me a sign 
i'm tired of the typical waitin on the wonderful something mystical, 
waitin on the wonderful i'm waitin on the wonderful something to set me free.
