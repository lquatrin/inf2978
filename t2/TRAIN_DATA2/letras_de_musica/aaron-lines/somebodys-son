I was watching the news tonight
Anchorman said there was a fight
And a young man died from his wounds
They showed pictures of the battle
And I almost turned the channel
Like I always seem to do
Then it hit me like a freight train coming through

ThatÂ’s somebodyÂ’s son,
SomebodyÂ’s husband,
SomebodyÂ’s everything,
Out there someoneÂ’s coming undone
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebodyÂ’s son

I walked down the hall to check
On my youngest lying in bed
And I stood there watching him dream
I tried but I couldnÂ’t imagine how we would feel if something happened
And I didnÂ’t have him here with me
Then I cried for that dead boy and his family

HeÂ’s somebodyÂ’s son,
SomebodyÂ’s husband,
SomebodyÂ’s everything,
Out there someoneÂ’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
HeÂ’s somebodyÂ’s son

SomebodyÂ’s son,
SomebodyÂ’s husband,
SomebodyÂ’s everything.
Out there someoneÂ’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody's son
