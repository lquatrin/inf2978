Where am I, what was that 
That made my heart beat so fast 
I'm somewhere now that I've never been 
So far from the world I was living in 

Baby, I'm lost, but I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I've found you 
When I'm around you, I'm lost 

I've come so far, I can't turn back 
There was no star, there was no night 
Well, I followed you to this place 
Now it's too late, standing here face to face 

Baby, I'm lost, but I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I've found you 
When I'm around you, I'm lost 

It just seems so right to be holding you tight 
I never thought it could feel so good to be lost 

Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I've found you 
When I'm around you, I'm lost 
But I'm not afraid 
I know you're the one to show me the way 
Lost in your arms, lost in your love 
Girl, since I've found you 
When I'm around you, I'm lost 

Baby, I'm lost
