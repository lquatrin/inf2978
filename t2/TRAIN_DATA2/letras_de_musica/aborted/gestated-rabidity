Malodorous scent of decay
Reeking my path to the storageshed
Urges deep inside the cortex
Raging through the cervix
Cranial decay... 

As I grab the saw... 

Eviscerated carnal delicatesse
Had been lying around for days
My cannibalistic malpractice enthralls
Gangrenous process in excess
Bereaving the swarm of flesh
A malpractice in necronutricious form... 

Malodorous and malicious
The haemoglobine infects my cortex
Artistically rearranging chromosomes
Intricate carnal thirst takes control
Furious and eloquent hunger
A shot
A fix
A plate of necrotorous pleasure 

Voraciously
The haematobic
Lesions infect and spread the haemoglobinic syndrome
Perversity
The haematobic
Lesions infect and spread
The hunger is back... 

Miscreant heretic foe
Causing me to resect
Natural life in defect... 

Spreading through the bloodflow... 

Eviscerated carnal delicatesse
Had been lying around for days
My cannibalistic malpractice enthralls
Gangrenous process in excess
Bereaving the swarm of flesh
A malpractice in necronutricious form... 

Malodorous and malicious
The haemoglobine infects my cortex
Artistically rearranging chromosomes
Intricate carnal thirst takes control
Furious and eloquent hunger
A shot
A fix
A plate of necrotorous pleasure
Gestated rabid hunger
A thousand tombs I plunder
