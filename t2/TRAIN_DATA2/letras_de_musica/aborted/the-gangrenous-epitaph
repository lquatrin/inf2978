Eve's stem defiled
Life led astray
The paradise of the damned has been misled 

Eve's stem defiled
Life led astray
Her eden desecrated 

Squirming like a beast
Man is the birthplace of disease
A parturient need for haemoglobine
One with the craving
Intrauterine
Man is the birthplace of disease
One with the killing
The blood released
Blessed with decay and left to rot
Like a cancer devours bowels and gut
Unfertile whores drowned in filth
Left with nothing to adore
A parturient need for seminal release
One with the craving
Intrauterine
Man is the birthplace of disease
One with the killing
The blood released
A slam of the fist brought Eden to her knees
One with the killing
Childhood has ceased
Foetal dead matter
Expulsed
Left to rot
Inanimate cadaver has been reanimated to a demigod 

Raping the dead... without emotion
Raping the dead... casket implosion
Raping the dead... without restraint
Raping the dead... necrotic epitaph 

Foetal dead matter
Repulsed and left to rot
Inanimate splatter
Revided to the plot 

Raping the dead... without emotion
Raping the dead... fecal explosion
Raping the dead... without restraint
Raping the dead... necrotic epitaph 

All acknowledge the graveyard sloth
When your bones are bleached it's time to meet my rod
Delicately misplaced into grandma's tomb
Post-mortal pleasures she lustfully endures 

I'm your maker
The body bag sprayer
When rigor mortis is reached
Testosterone is at its top
I'm a necrotic succubi
The plague of men
When all of you are dead
You shall be my lustful grub 

The gangrenous epitaph...
