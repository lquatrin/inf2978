See- the waste
His rancid stinking spunk, sparkling in the moonlightï¿½

Torn apart by hooks, celebral lobes are emerging
from the cavities. Convulsive regurgitations
of decomposed entrails. The reek of putrefaction
corporal perdition fall upon thee.
Bludgeeoned th death, suppurating liquids,
I savour your skin

Extemporaneous exploration
of the mass beneath the skull.
Countenance completely minced,
The cranial skin is excoriated.
Bulging eyes I pierce, scraping the cornea
Intersection of the carotid.

Extirpation of the dying pile of puke
Excressence of humanity, an organic cesspool
Androgynous propagation,
Of my pathological murderousness
