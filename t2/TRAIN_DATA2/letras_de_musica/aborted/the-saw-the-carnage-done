Emulous life form emerges, and slashes continuously 
A man made predator slides back moral, self censored reality 

Crushing through my veins 
Coagulating awareness 
Chromosomes regressed 
With the saw, I shall purge 
Taking the next step, 
The robbing of life 
Anticipating blood flow 
Feelings of contempt arise 

No longer in control, I crave the dead 
One with the dead, I am 

A prophetized death machine, unleashed 
Bones are splintered as I saw, Decadence to feed 
Murder is mankind's only saviour, Goremageddon... 

Sawig up stiffs to my every need, 
decadence to feed 
Feeding, and praying on man, 
to cleanse the world, decandence exceeds

Emulous life form emerges, 
and slashes repeatedly 
A man made predator feeding 
on its own creator, your society 

Feeding, and praying on man, to cleanse the world, 
decadence exceeds 
Sawing up stiffs to my every need, 
decadence to feed
