Bob's bizarre bazaar of murder
Every part of my mind set to procreate torture 

A trail of mayhem is the path I walk
I'm a birthmarked psychopath with pandora's box 

Berdella's home store of murder
Every part of my mind set to procreate torture
Bondage eden of orgasmic lust
Flooding the soil with blood and debris 

Enter thy household, exit in red
My sole satisfaction is to see you being bled 

Euthanasia
Death's poetry
Brute splendour
Vermillion disease
The leading role in a wretched flick 

Social pressure depressing the weak
Pushing the limit to force-feed humility 

Self proclaimed cold logistic slaughter
Infamous advertisement for common cattle
Flooding the soil with blood and debris
All bow down to Bob's store of the extreme
