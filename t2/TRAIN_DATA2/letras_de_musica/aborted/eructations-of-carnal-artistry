Random torture, suffer by my hand 
Slicing and cutting, submit to my torment 
Pierced with nails, wired to the celing 
Reincarnated puppet, patched human being 
Vacilating on the verge in a blaze of gory 
Moulding the eructations of my carnal artistry 

Gathering the insides, winnowing inferior guts 
I sever and dismember, hack fervidly with gasping cuts 

Muscular limbs, a perfect casket 
The slenderest torso, how fanatic can I get ? 
Diffirent corporal parts, agglutinated with suture 
From a mental delusion to a morbid stature 

Rashes of skin, stiched from within 
I'm pulling the strings, resurgence spreads its wings 
Veins are dangling, bloody chunks exfoliate 
Its countenace purses, the artefact expectorates 
My creative is urge fed by engineering the dead 
Excessive gore is what I need 
to nurture my carnarstistic need.
