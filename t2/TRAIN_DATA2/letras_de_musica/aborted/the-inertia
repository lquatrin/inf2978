Watch it scream
Eyelids scrutinize in this portrait of idolatry and rot
Her body so fragile
Now in post-mortal hands
I am retouching the essence of feminine refinement 

All soothing scalpel guideth me to my vision
The era of the vane killed the beauty of creation 

Motionless
Paralyzed with awe
Your face
A canvas
Untouched 

Blooming like a cancer
Narcissistic nightmare
Maleficient and repulsed at your own sight 

Eyelids scrutinize in this portrait of idolatry and rot
Her body so fragile
Now broken by my hands
I am retouching to the essence of repulsion 

What is vanity but a shell yearning to be cracked
A shattered dream chased by the misfortuned 

Aging atrociously
Accelerated by a vision of skin consumed 

The era of the vane killed the beauty of creation
Blatant display of plasticine horror 

And the big mass is impressed
You are so beautiful
Crafted by the finest hands
Torn apart by the finest tools
Put back together like a menstrual soup 

You are so beautiful
Lit disgust to my eyes at dusk
Your are so pitiful
Your face tainted and deformed 

Eyelids scrutinize
In this portrait of idolatry and rot
Her body so fragile
Now broken by my hands
I am retouching in a tell-tale of drama caught
