Genesis, ill - natured from the womb
I am an example, identified, malice in its purest from
Forged by disgust, my inner torment
Origin recognized from the primeval mass

I'm omega reborn -
The dawn of omega return
I'm an example of filth and disgust
The essence of humanity, the true nature of crud
To bring havoc and global unrest
My hatred rooted firmly from my misconception
I'm the archetype of man

All those that fell before my knees
Vermin, atrocities
Not worthy of contemplation
Anomalies, imperfections
All those that fell before my knees
Vermin, atrocities
Not worthy of contemplation
Anomalies, imperfections

Call it a leap of faith
I will guide you to death
Slavery a luxury to come
In this hell you brought on your own

Genesis, ill - natured from the womb
I am an example, identified, malice in its purest from
Forged by disgust, my inner torment
Origin recognized from the primeval mass

I'm omega reborn
I'm the archetype of man
I'm an example of filth and disgust
The essence of humanity, the true nature of crud
To bring havoc and global unrest
My hatred rooted firmly from my misconception
I'm the archetype of man
I'm the voice of your nation
