There will be no single warning!
As you see the flashing lighten in the sky.

You will see the next red morning and will smell your pealing skin.
There is no doubt 'bout what will happen, it's for sure that we all die.
Could you turn back the hands of time if it showed up in your sight.

Bodies shrivelling, boiled away.
Raddle is the flesh, turned well done!
Bodies blackening, carbonised
Felt the radiance, left behind.
There will be no single warning!
As you see the flashing lighten in the sky.

As you see the flashing lighten in the sky.

Faced your deprivation to late.

There's one conclusion. That we are left to be doomed.
Knowledge is despised. Raging in the source of heat.

On earth's nearest star. Nucleus after extinction.
Died out afterglow. Gasping into repulsion.

Saw the light, felt the wind, mass emission.
In beyond as what we have seen before.
Felt the heat, rasped off skin, mass emission.
Blasted in oblivion.

Deadly light. Died out souls.

There's one conclusion. That we are left to be doomed.
Knowledge is despised. Raging in the source of heat.

Could you catch sight of explosions in your reach?
Twinkle in your eye and for sure blinded.
Blinded by the light. Crying out your fright.
On mime devoured. Light of day died out.
Could you deny sight of explosions in your reach?
Mutilated face, your brains cooked well done.
Taken by the light, no mortal remains...
On mime devoured. Deadly light! Died out souls.
