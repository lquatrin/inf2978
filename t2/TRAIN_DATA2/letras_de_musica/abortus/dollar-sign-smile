I've seen through your dollar sign smile 
Exploitation of weaker times grieving suffering not mild 
Cash flow the only thing on your mind 
Behind your desk hands together rubbing 
Your mind drifting focusing on one thing 
What usually happens here is just profiting 
But keep talking, yes I'm listening 

You're so fucking kind caring exists 
Where profit worsens grief 
[Repeat] 

Understand it costs a lot to show respect 
Fees here and you take whatever's left 
Sign here for the afterlife special deal 
Consoling pat on the hand how do you feel 
I see through your dollar sign smile 
Exploitation of weaker times grieving suffering not mild 
Cash flow the only thing on your mind 

You're so fucking kind you see them coming 
You know they'll fall with pockets open 
You'll catch them all laid to rest 
Time for respect but in your eyes 
There's dollar signs 
[Repeat] 

A dollar sign smile 
With dollar sign smile 
[Lead Gooch] 

Your profit worsens the grief 
There's no let off or release 
Your profit worsens the grief 
Let's see how you cope 
When it's your time
