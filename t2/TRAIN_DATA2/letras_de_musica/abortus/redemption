The next best path to nothing is the way in which you live 
Take it don't leave it because the choice is not yours 
Void is the path that controls your immortal toil 
Your soul lies dormant when your bodies in the soil 

[Pre-Chorus] 
The lies they feed - the love the greed 
The empty need (it's written on your face) 
Just lies and greed your soul they need 
On the weak they feed (it's written on your face) 
Just lies and greed the souls they need 
The weakness breeds (it's written on your face) 
The lies the greed your soul they need 
The weakness breeds 
And it's written on your face 

[Chorus] 
If you wanna hear the truth then don't believe in the lies 
We'll only find the answers when we die 

[Melody Gooch] 

How can you spoonfeed these lies to the children laid to rest 
They're just fucked up views infecting innocent soil 
Righteousness covers grief well hidden behind golden masks 
Security blanket your book of understanding 
That you lack 

[Repeat Pre-Chorus] 
[Repeat Chorus] 
[Lead Gooch] 

The next best choice to nothing is control the life you live 
Leave them don't take it because the choice is now yours 
Door knockin hysteria controls their mortal toil 
Their life is gone all golden plans now foiled 

[Repeat Pre-Chorus] 
[Repeat Chorus]
