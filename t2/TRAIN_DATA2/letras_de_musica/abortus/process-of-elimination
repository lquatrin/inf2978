[Verse #1] 
Dozens have fallen but there's still many to go 
And one by one I know your colours will show 
They're shining straight through your transparent exteriors 
It's time to weed out these unwanted inferiors 

[Verse #2] 
And when you call regret that's when i'll know revenge 
My horns they will show from the deep angers pent 
Frustration my tool it's now sharpened by hate 
Venting no more, You I humiliate 

[chorus #1] 
The process of the discovery of truth 
The process of the filtration of this filth 
The process of the re-written rule 
The process of elimination 

[Melody Gooch] 
[Verse #3] 
Your bridge is now burnt and I'm holding the flame 
No longer intending to carry your blame 
The sorting of souls gone left in the lerch 
I'm void of these feelings, these feelings of hurt 

[Verse #4] 
Because the shit on one's shoe need no longer stick 
Well under my carpet that's where all you fuckers fit 
The pile remaining stagnation breeds rot 
Completing the process, the process of... 

[Repeat Chorus #1] 
[Repeat Verse #4] 
[Lead Jack] 
[Lead Gooch] 

[Chorus #2] 
The process of the awakening of truth 
The process of my freedom from your guilt 
The process of my trials now end 
The process of elimination 

[Melody Gooch] 
[Repeat Verse #4]
