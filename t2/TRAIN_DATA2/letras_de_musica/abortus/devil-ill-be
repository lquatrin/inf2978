What started this lie 
Confront the visions 
That eat away at your insides 
No focus just haze 
Elude reality born from your minds eye 
your consciousness implies the right 
To justify your faceless point of life 
Invision all for all 
Your ego part of the picture 
You now feel fine 
Your job is done it's off your chest 
You say you've sorted out my life 
But the truth besides the point 
Now everything 
Is just right in your eyes 
[Lead Gooch] 

Deaf ears they hear 
Listen with a blank stare 
The nerve to tell me who I am 
What goes around 
Will come back on you twice as hard 
[Lead Gooch]
