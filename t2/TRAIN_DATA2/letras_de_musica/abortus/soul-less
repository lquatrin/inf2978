Soul-less lies beneath the exterior
Incapable now constantly I fall
In my blind eyes
Inevitable life's doom stalks near

Soul-less dead beneath the exterior
Incapable & constant I fall
My eyes bleed now
The inevitable doom, it draws near
Forseen it was foretold, reject to recollect
Forseen it was foretold, reject to recollect


Dense grey laughing as I turn to see
Fears left behind, now I need all
In this life, embedded was to be a failure

Soul-less scarred arms
Brings in the end to the new day
Now all that I know
Feeds into collapsing veins
Forseen it was foretold, reject to recollect
Forseen it was foretold, reject to recollect

(Repeat Chorus)

Dark, cold & grey. Future lies not there to see

Forseen I was told, reject all thoughts that recollect (times 3)

(Repeat first verse times 2)
