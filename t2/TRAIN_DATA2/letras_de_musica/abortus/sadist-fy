[Melody Jack] 
Forcing of values once sent 
Now preying on seeds of your innocence 
Knowing full well the whole time 
Deep seeded repression once held in tight 
Boils from behind 

Chosen my victim no longer restricted 
Gods will forced upon you 
You tell I whill scorn you 
For I am the power, I rape and you cower 
Need not bother telling gods will I am selling 
But years of denial has bred habits vile 
You must understand control is in my hands 
If you talk I will lie the commandments aside 
I will never stand trial cause gods love on me smiles 
[Lead Jack] 

[Chorus] 
Loosing everything I thought was right 
Knowing what I thought now pushed aside 
Feeling the desire growing from inside 
Killing the lives of my victims minds 
[Repeat] 
[Lead Jack] 
[Lead Gooch] 
[Repeat twice] 

The cross that I bear that's gods armour I wear 
Question me not 

[Lead Gooch] 
[Repeat Chorus x2]
