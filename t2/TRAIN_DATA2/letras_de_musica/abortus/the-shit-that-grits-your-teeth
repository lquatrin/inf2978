One true passion, reality
Joy of expression, through other means
Certainly carries what faith hopes to hold
The need to be is getting cold
What my God sees lies deep in me
Cause if I can't feel what seems surreal
The hand of death will surely deal
The stagnant house
where no-one believes

It's the shit that grits your teeth
It's the shit that grits your teeth

(Repeat first verse)

It's the shit that grits your teeth
It's the shit that grits your teeth

Tell me what it's like
Not to know yourself
Cause this I've never known
Herd like mentality, sheepish
Cause that I don't want to know

One true passion, reality
Joy of expression, through other means
Certainly carries what faith hopes to hold
The need to be is getting cold
