Must be a dull existance 
Change channels your condition 
To fill the empty mind T.V. is your lifeline 

Take in what you see 
Believe all that you read 
The afternoon edition 
Enhancing your condition 

Couch life's a philosophy 
Thrive on the tears of Winfrey 
A plague that eats the mind 
All real now left behind 

Please Ricki dance for me 
Arms raised in ecstacy 
A conversation piece 
The joy's showing from release 

[Chorus] 
God vision, feel god 
God vision, need god 
God vision, clap god 
God vision, fuck god 

[Spoken] 
These icons live upon your shelf 
Your loosing grip they're gaining wealth 
Just sit and stare no need to care 
Your life now through I'll think for you 

Just leave it up to me fulfilling all your dreams 
I'm the master of the screen I'm all you'll ever need 

[Repeat Chorus]
