Let me start it off, 'cause I'm a player 
Fade into part two, I'm the number-one ho layer 
A mack, a player, and a pimp 
Something much stronger than your average drink 
Now correct me if I'm wrong, I'm like moonshine 
Take a sip of my rhyme and I take over your mind 
'Cause I don't think like the average thinker 
Call me the nightstalker of your neighbourhood headshrinker 
187 is like a megablast 
I take too many names, I kick too much ass 
K.M.G, the number-one mack daddy 
Eatin' chicken like a motherfucker, rollin' in my Caddy 
With my brim cold bent to the side 
I bump and slide 
Go mack in the back, 187 to the side 
Street Pilgrims pioneering the land 
Above the law status with a gat in my hand 
A mind designed like Frank Nitty 
Livin' large on the mike, doin' damage for the city 
The city of toners which is known as L.A. 
Where the hustlers hustle and the ballers play 
We got the dope beats from the homeboy Dre 
And it had to be done (How?) the Ruthless way 
187, what's up?, what do we do at our show 
We wear black on black with the locs and the romeos 
Start stepping, unload my mike weapon 
We say it's fittin', you think it's hittin' 
K.M.G means knowledge most greatly 
Some people love me, most people hate me 
In other words, I kick my gift 
Do you be sleeping, K.M.G? 
Nah, I don't drift 
I lounge or lay 'cause suckers take advantage 
Yo, what do we do? 
Yo, we doin' damage 
'Cause we not punks, fools, sissies, or busters 
And the way that we live is 
Like hustlers 
Livin' like hustlers 
I used to sell big lleyo on the block 
Remember all the hardheads, getting all the hard knocks 
I started with Gs and then I moved to keys 
And at this point my life went with ease 
In other words, my pockets was thick 
I didn't worry about the Feds, I was checking the mic. 
Pull a swoop to Farouk, got dressed to please 
Got the crib pimped out so that the bitches flee'd 
I bought a ride, a white Corvette 
So I can do a ghost move when it's time to jet 
When I was nineteen, I was on my own 
Hooked up big connections on my mobile phone 
At home, or maybe on my person 
To clock big G's I'd be definitely certain 
To live the lifestyle, the luxury, the freaks, the frills 
Yo, you was livin' kinda large 
On the real-deals was bein' made 
Suckers was gettin' sprayed 
In other words, we was gettin' paid 
Like hustlers 
Livin' like hustlers 
Let me proceed 'cause I got the green light 
For the numero uno 87 it must be hype 
For now, let me lay the cards on the table 
So you can figure out who's worried or stable 
I max and tax and relax and stack Gs 
Stick that to the facts, that's why I crack them with ease 
Please get off the convoy, I think you're confused 
When you cross, I told you you'd get tossed and you lose 
Now A-b-o-v-e-L-a-w to some people now that spells trouble 
But we're not a group promoting violence 
But when it comes to speakin' the real, I won't be silent 
Speak all reality when I'm on the mike 
So you don't have to run and have a stereotype 
See, see 'cause stereotypes will make you dumb 
So kick back and listen, yo, to the knowledge that's brung 
See the law has provided me, the K.M.G 
That's complex with the style but done easily 
Pitch a picture if I have to, you know why 
I'm undercover doin' dirt I'm a hell of a spy 
Now me, 187, is a detonator 
More deadly than a hand grenade 
Much harder than a fool to fade 
Not a forty, not a quart or six-pack 
Me, K.M.G, Total K-OSS, and Go Mack 
'Cause I unload my weapon with force 
Yeah, I'm never detected, I get respected 
As a baller, a player, or a pimp 
Yo, pass me the forty, I commence to dent 
A sissy soft sucker with no title 
Unplug the machine 187 is vital 
Like a Beretta with a megaclip 
With a silencer on it with the hollow point tip 
But that is our business, on that we won't dwell 
We make records for you to look, listen, and tell 
Tell your ma, tell a friend, tell a fool, or a jerk 
Till them K.M.G people started to put it to work 
Like Hustlers 
Livin' like hustlers
