We for breakin backs in the 9-4, time to play a hoe
Like we never did before
Since the prices went up for a piece a ass
See i still get freebies cause i got gap
And when it comes to the question
""what have you done for me lately?""
Yo, g, i make them bitches hate me

[kmg]
So grab ya coat, grab ya hat, cause its like that
Ya try and play the role and ain't nothin but a hood rat
So don't front yeah you're names terri not halle
But you sprung like a motherfucker when i
Hit that berry and let a hoe know whats poppin
Cause it comes with the territory when you come a jockey

(chorus)
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right

[kmg]
Yeah i'm in the mood i need a hoe with much aptitude
To creep wicked, to come kick it
With the p-i-m-p, pimp clinic number 1
Ya say i ain't shit but cha sprung
But ya holds the number then folds the number
Then ya crawls to my house for a late night slumber

[cold187]
Yeah cause bitches in the 90s ain't shit
They claim that they a lady steady suckin every other niggaz dick
So now you at my house on my couch screamin out
My name, my status and my motherfuckin clout
""and ya nigga don't know whats goin on""
Cause he always broke and he always gone
Now people might say that i am scandlous
But it ain't my fault if a bitch can't handle this

(chorus)

[kokane]
Now i just had lit a flya show
I bumped up so i gotta spit at the hoe
Yeah she bound to let me smoke but make no mistake
I gotta 8 year bid next day for a rape
Owww, actin like crows
And ya wonder why we call ya bitches and s
