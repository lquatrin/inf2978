Memories are back
And I fuck out the chains of life
In true Hell is cold, like here
On a snow in blood
Everywhere - hot, sweet blood
I don't feel as my morbid soul cry
Fear in the eyes of victim join me
This must be illusion
I cut my knife into screaming flesh
But peaceless in my Lust, Perversion, Hate
The Spirit walked through thousand Eons
No rest in peace - never
Fighting again and again
