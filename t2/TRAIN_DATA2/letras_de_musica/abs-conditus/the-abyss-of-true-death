From the night, desire arrive
From the abyss of darkness
Suffering... scream
Kill, kill, kill!
Darkness, my tears are drinking...
...freezing to ice.
Dried autumn's leafs hide the... grave
Blood congealed on a keen, iron
...edge in my hand

Again, fear get at me, and sun...
...of day
Insane in hate, i lost myself
In the abyss of deadly yearnings
In the abyss of true death
