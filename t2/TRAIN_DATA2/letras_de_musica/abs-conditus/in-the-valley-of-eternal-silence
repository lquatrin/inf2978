Dead grey of sky, twilight
Demons turning to trees
Nocturnal fog brings the gravesbreath
Bleak clouds talk to me: "Walk forth"
Malediction and power - they tear me
And I see...
One Satan's Light
Silence, so I am silent... silence
Goat takes me from away
Ancient Wisdom shall speak
The revenge of thundersword
In the valley of eternal silence
