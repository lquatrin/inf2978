I smile 
I cry 
I breathe 
You are good 
You give 
I take 
Life moves 
Ends too soon 

There's a never-ending passion running in my veins 
And I'm drunk on its conviction 
And I savor every taste 
I want to be salt 
Salt of the earth 
Then You can rain down Your living water 
And quench the thirst 
Take my best and all my faults 
Grind them up and make me salt 

Lord, make me salt They work 
They dream 
They hope 
Like I do 
They need 
They strive 
Life's hard without You 
It slowly kills a part of me 
Your word's not heard 
So use what You can of me to help preserve 

The good that's in this world 
It won't be easy 
'Cause nothing that matters ever is 
So I will let go 
Swallow all my pride and comfort 
I promise You 
I won't be watered-down
