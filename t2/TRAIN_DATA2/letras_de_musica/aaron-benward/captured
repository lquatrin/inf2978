I have to tell You 
I'm captured inside 
You shaped my world 
Brought me to life 
You're my freedom 
You gave me my wings 
To fly so high 

I see heaven 
You have opened my eyes 
I feel forever 
'Cause Your heart is close to mine 
The moment You set me free 
Was the moment You captured me 
You captured me 

The hope I carry 
Is deepened by You 
You're the one I hold on to 
You're my salvation 
I give all of me to You 
Oh yes, I do
