I get a feelin', it chases every breath I take, yeah 
You know it's Your love that's making me smile this way 
I have tried and tried to break it down 
Always find it simple yet profound 
You're the song that's on my lips 
I'd be singing even if 
There was no one ever listening 
'Cause You're the blue skies in my eyes 
And You make me realize 
That it's groovy just to be alive 
Alive I can't imagine any minute without Your touch 
It's hard to fathom 
It's so easy to feel so much 
For all the fascinations that I've found 
It's still Your love that makes my world go 
'Round and 'round and around 
Your love is like breathing 
So exhilarating 
Your love makes me want to 
Stop and soak life in
