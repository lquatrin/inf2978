God wants nothing more from you right now 
Than for you to understand His heart 
Calm all the whispers in your head 
Just be still 
Listen 
You will hear 
Echoing from deep inside He believes in you 
And all the dreams you dream of 
Every hope and prayer you lean on 
He will see them through 
And know that day 
Is waiting just beyond tomorrow 
I know it's true 
It's because in you He believes 
"Why?" is probably what you ask yourself 
The answer to your question won't make sense 
God, He didn't come to lift the proud 
But for the least, the forgotten and the lost 
Even when it's hard to receive 
'Cause He made you for greater things 
He believes in you no matter 
No matter how you see yourself 
Hold on to the unchanging heart 
Heart of God
