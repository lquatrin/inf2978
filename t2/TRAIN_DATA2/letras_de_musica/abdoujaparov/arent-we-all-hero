Let me tell you something I really miss 
High on my list is getting pissed 
Let me tell you something that will make you see 
The real me, is only three 

I'm shouthing and I'm screaming 
And I wish that I was dreaming 
I've got forty thousand pounds 
That I'm keeping undergrounds 
There are 20 domb commuters 
Sitting on my computer 
Here at last, here to stay 
In love with aCptain Jaynaway 

Let me tell you something that I can do without 

Without a doubt, it's football louts 
Let me tell you something that makes me mad 
It makes me sad, the newish lad 

I'm shouthing and I'm screaming 
And I wish that I was dreaming 
I've got forty thousand pounds 
That I'm keeping undergrounds 
There are 20 domb commuters 
Sitting on my computer 
Here at last, here to stay 
In love with Captain Jaynaway 

I'm not really a hreo, I'm not cut out for that life 
Turn that Marshall to zero, I'm going back to my wife 
I don't wanna play (Rock 'n Roll) with a rock 'n roll band 
My finger's broke, my back's a joke 
My hair's a mess, I'm undefr stress 
Aren't we all 

Let me tell you something that will make you laugh 
I wear a scarf in the bath 
Let me tell you something that will make you cry 
I'd rather die than keep it dry 

I'm shouthing and I'm screaming 
And I wish that I was dreaming 
I've got forty thousand pounds 
That I'm keeping undergrounds 
There are 20 domb commuters 
Sitting on my computer 
Here at last, here to stay 
In love with Captain Jaynaway 
There's a man in pink pyjamas and a boy banarama 
There are fishes in the sea all uglier than me 
There's a major independent, from a hippy descendent 
There's an actor in the bill, with his finger's in my till 
I just wanna play (Rock 'n Roll) with a rock 'n roll band 
My finger's broke, my back's a joke 
My hair's a mess, I'm undefr stress 
Aren't we all
