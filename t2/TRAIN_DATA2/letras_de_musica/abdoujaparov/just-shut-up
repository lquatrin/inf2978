I feel like I'm inside a jumper 
In a suit inside of a bell 
And I feel like I'm losing my temper 
With that joyless and sickening smell 

I wish I could go to the seaside 
And wallow about in the mud 
And there I can urinate freely 
In my trousers, alone, on my todd 

I would give the world to be 
In love, with peace and harmony 

Can't someone give me peace and quiet 
I think I'll go and start and riot 

But you won't know until you try it 
But you won't know until you try it 

I feel like I'm riding a camel 
I've got dromedarian hump 
Now I am lost in a tunnel 
And desoerately needing a dump 

Can't someone give me peace and quiet! 
I think I'll go and start and riot 
But you won't know until you try it 
But you won't know until you try it 
Won't someone give me peace of mind 
A load of bollocks I think you'll find 
A load of bollocks I think you'll find 
A load of bollocks I think you'll find 

I feel like I'm losing my marbles 
Lost touch with my mission control 
I've given away my firebird 
To the one with the hair out of hole 
I would give my pig's eye tooth 
To learn to speak and tell the truth 
Millet.....Rice......Organic.....Not nice 
Spinach.....Hotspur...Taxi.....Kit-e-Kat 
Oh why don't you SHUT UP!
