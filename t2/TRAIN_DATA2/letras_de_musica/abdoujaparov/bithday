Here's a tragic story of a boy with a laid-to-waist 
I was told to me by a mutual friend 
And it's true un;ess he lied to my face 
Californian legen, your face is a face of a start 
Your future's so bright and your startsign's so right 
You're s Gemini born in a car 

It's you birthday 
It's the worst day 

Your parents threw a party, invited you and your friends 
But someone there was ready to blow off your head 
What a way for a party to end 
What a way for a party to end 

It's your birthday 
It's the worse day 

Everyone was there at your funeral 
I stayed home to watch the V 

There was a film with you in that I'd only seen once 
And I wanetd to remember you that way 

It's your birhtday 

And the heat of the candles 
Put the colour in your cheeks 
And they turned down the screws 
Andf they turned away the freaks 
Said a word or two about so many dying so yound 

Then they turned up the heat set the temperature to burn 
Then they turned up the heat set the temperature to burn
