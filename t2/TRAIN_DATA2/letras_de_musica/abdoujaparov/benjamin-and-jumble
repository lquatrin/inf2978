I've a friend called Benjamin who rents a first floor flat 
diirectly opposite the Midland bamk 
His best friend's called Jumble 
He met her in a church hall 
She didn't have a clue, what a glass of alcohol could do 

She loved him, he loves her so 
Jumble made herself at home 
A bar for the boys and a drink for the girls 

I hope I fall in love tonight 
I hope I fall inlove tonight 
The moon is full 
The stars are bright 
I hope I fall in love tonight 

Threee months later the rot set in 
She realsied the state he was in 
And late one night, she called me 
said she had to get put 
She had it up to here and without a doubt 
She was miserable and so kissable 

She'd grown tired of intimacy 
He's grabbed her by the throat you see 
She ended up in casualty 

I hope I fall in love tonight 
I hope I fall inlove tonight 
The moon is full 
The stars are bright 
I hope I fall in love tonight 

From now on the song gets brighter 
My broad shoulders helped to comfort her 
She soon forgot 
We fell in love along the ay 
I'm still with her to this very day 
It's miraculous, I'm so vacuous 

She loves me I love her so 
24 kids and a mobile phone 
A pipe and slippers and an old settee 

I'm deep in debt and finally 
I'v efound the fliipin' life for me 
I'm settled down in London town 
And nothing's gonna get me down
