Look at me, I'm only here for fun 
Life's too short, stick your finger up your bum 
Go for a walk, go for a swim 
Don't blame me, for the state that you're in 

I'm innocent like vinocent Oh yeah 
I'm innocent like vinoecnt Oh yeah 

Look at me, I'm as happy as can be 
I can't climb to the top of the tree 

Coz, I'm innocent like vinocent Oh yeah 
Coz, I'm innocent like vinocent Oh yeah 

Tons of fluffy clouds, smiling lucky crowds 
We are very happy and you'll never make us frown 
Millions of starts, new and shiny cars 
We are very happy and you'll never bring us down 

Look at me, I'm as high as a kite 
I wish you luck and I say goodnight 

Coz, I'm innocent like vinocent Oh yeah 
Coz, I'm innocent like vinocent Oh yeah
