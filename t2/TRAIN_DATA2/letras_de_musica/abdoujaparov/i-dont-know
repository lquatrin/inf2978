You've got a feeling for making me ill 
You've got a knack for breaking on my back 
I can't believe how much you get on my wick 
You can't conceive, you really are thick 

Don't ask me why I said that, I don't know 
I've got a great big mouth and my brain is much too slow 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 

Get into your head, two spoons in a bed 
Don't make the ground shake and splutter around 
Hot water bottle, grows in the night 
Sensible shoes give me the blues 

Don't ask me why I said that, I don't know 
I've got a great big mouth and my brain is much too slow 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 

When it comes to the crunch, you give me my lunch 
When it comes to the rub, you give me your love 
I just sit and wait for your heart to break 
I can't believe how much shit you take 

Don't ask me why I said that, I don't know 
I've got a great big mouth and my brain is much too slow 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
