The day I put a match to No. 3 
I made those fucking grown-ups notice me 
I didn't think a tiny fire would grow that big 
I didn't know the smoke and fumes would make me sick 

Beautiful flames, sulphur and heat 
Carefully fanned 
Fire-engine siren 
Fire tender red 

I knew they kept some petrol in the shed 
I threw her precious photos on the bed 
I found a box of matches in a drawer 
And I wedged his favourite chair against the door 

Beautiful flames, sulphur and heat 
Carefully fanned 
Fire-engine siren 
Fire tender red 

I failed to reach the phone in time 
In time to dial 999 
I woke up in a hospital 
Bandage on my head 
Mum and Dad are dead 
Fire tender red
