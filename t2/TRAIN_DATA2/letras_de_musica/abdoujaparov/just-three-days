Just three days to go 
Darling I don't know 
Do you think that its all worthwhile 
Is it all for show 
Darling I don't know 
Darling I don't know 
Just three days to go 
Darling I don't know 
Even though you're dead 
Against we'll go ahead 
Its too late to pull out 
Do something else instead 
Darling I don't know 
Darling I don't know 
Just three days until, 
The blood and guts are spilled 
I hope that we survive 
I hope we don't get killed (or murdered) 
Rightly, silent, but then 
There's no right to silence when 
The hammer of justice 
Cracks the nuts of the weak 
Forcing the witness to speak 
Darling I don't know
