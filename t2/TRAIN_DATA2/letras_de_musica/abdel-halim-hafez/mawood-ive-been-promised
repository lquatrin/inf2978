The path has awakened our senses.
Bet sahy el tareek khataweena,

The sky weeps for us
El sama betebky aleina
And our days of grief.
Wel nay el hazeen.
Our days of grief.
El nay el hazeen.

And the moon will vanish,

Through the nights of regret.

Wet khalee el hob ba-eed ana,
We won't wait for him.
Wala nestana,
So he shouldn't wait for us.
Wala yestana.
