You push yourself on me
Force yourself on me
Free yourself through me
You better save yourself from me
Every time you want me to be
Something I could never be
Guess you'll have to wait and see
Till the next time that you have to

Come again
Come again
This time you will have to
Come again
Come again

I hate myself for you
I break myself for you
I'd kill myself for you
I'd better save myself from you
Every time you want me to be
Something I could never be
Guess you'll have to wait and see
Till the next time that you have to

Come again
Come again
This time you will
Come again
Come again
Mother fucker you will have to
Come again
Come again
This time you will
Come again
Come again
Mother fucker you will have to
Come again
Come again

If you have to walk my way
Have something to say
Get the fuck away
Can't take one more day
I cannot conform

Come again
Come again
This time you will
Come again
Come again
Mother fucker you will have to
Come again
Come again
This time you will
Come again
Come again
Mother fucker you will have to
Come again
Come again
