Are you afraid
Afraid of the truth
In the mirror staring back at you
The image is cracked
But so is the view here
And the strength of a tree
Begins in the roots
That I tend to bury into you
At least now the storm
Can't blow me away

So crawl inside
My head with me
I'll show you how
It feels to be
To blame like me

Should I be afraid
Of this face that I see
In the mirror staring back at me
So cold were the days
When I listened to you
And you say that I'm weak
So show me the proof
Because I still exist inspite of you
But I won't compete
With you every day

So crawl inside
My head with me
I'll show you how
It feels to be
To blame like me

Schizophrenic conversations that I'm always having with myself
I hear these
Voices in my head competing, maybe I could use a little help
I still have
Schizophrenic conversations when there's no one else around to hear
I long for
Solitude and peace within me, void of all the anger and the fear

So crawl inside
My head with me
And I'll show you how it feels to be
Fucked up like me
I'll show you how it feels to be
To blame like me
Ashamed like me
