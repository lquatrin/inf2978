The walls around me caving in
Cracked and grey
Remind me of myself, I need some help
There's no one else
I'm empty
Addicted
Pissed off
And still afraid
Of what you
Have left me
To live in
This mess you've made

I feel...
Useless...
Jaded...
Nameless

the ride is over I've come down
Hate to be
Can't rely upon myself, for my own health
I'm so fucked up
Distorted
Dysfunctional
and drained
All my deep rooted
Fears seem to get
The best of me

I feel...
Useless...
Jaded...
Nameless

I hate the way you fuck with me
You can't rely on open eyes to see
I force these painful visions from my head
You won't be happy till I break down

I feel...
Useless...
Jaded...
Nameless
