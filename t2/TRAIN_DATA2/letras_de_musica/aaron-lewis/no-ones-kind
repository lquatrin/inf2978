What the fuck's the purpose
i didn''t scratch the surface
immune to what your saying
all along decaying
can't see thru the fire
darkness, lone desire
quiet in my corner
building up the border

can't stand the way you make me feel
today
no one's kind is all you'll ever be

can't see thru the rain
too much pain
am i insane
too much time
no sublime
loss of energy
no symmetry
fuck society
lost in nievate

chorus:
can't stand the way you make me...
can'' take the pain you break me...
can't bite the hand that feeds me...
can't take away what's in me

addicted to the feelings
lose touch with all i've known
the cobwebs on the ceiling
make me aware that i'm all alone

the endless rain washes all away
makes clean the mess i have make
