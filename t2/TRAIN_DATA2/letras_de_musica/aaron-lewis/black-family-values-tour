Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay.
were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
shade beneath the clouds
Of what was everything?
Oh, the pictures seared all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter,
So why do I sear?
and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures seared all been washed in black,
tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be...yeah...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be the sun
In somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine...
