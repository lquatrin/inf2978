I heard today that you were gone
i had to stop and sing along
the song they played to say goodbye
a song they gave, give me back life


you'll never fade
the words you gave
my life you saved
your name was layne
and on that day a child was born
to someone who you helped along
and helped see through his darkest times
because of you, this child she is mine


[bridge]

the words you said, you made me feel like they were all for me
the words you said, they will always be a part of me
the words you said, you made me feel like i was not alone
the words you said, you gave me all the strength to carry on

[chorus (altered)]

so to me you'll never fade
your life you gave
my life you saved
your name was layne
