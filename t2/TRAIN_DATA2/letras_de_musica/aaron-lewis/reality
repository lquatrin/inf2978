the lights are on but you're not home
you've drifted off somewhere alone
somewhere that's safe,
no questions here
a quiet place where you hide from your fears


sometimes when you're out of rope
the way to climb back up's unclear
the walls you build around yourself
i guess they also keep you there
are you afraid of what they thing?
whoever "they" happen to be
or are you hiding from the scars of your own reality?

so you sedate and drown in vain
you've got a pill for every day
a suit and tie to mask the truth
its ugly head is starthing to show through


[bridge]

the monster you're feeding,
your lack of perception
the things you will do
to fullfill addictions
the light at the end of your tunnel is closing
what is it that you're so afraid of exposing?
you'd give it all up for what's there for the taking
whatever it takes to keep your hands from shaking
the same things you're thinking might make you feel better
the same things that probably get you here
