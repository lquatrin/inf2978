I know an angel
Sent here for me
Sent down from heaven
To set me free
Sent here to save me
Save me from me
And when I'm cold
Will you, still be there to comfort me? 
And when I get old
Will you, still be there to talk to me? 
And am I so bold, to think I deserve something as good as you? 

I met a hero
For this I'm sure
In thirty days now
They go to war
And fight for something
That some don't see
They fight for freedom
They fight for me
And when they're old
Will you, still be there to comfort them? 
And when they get old
Will you, still be there to talk to them? 
And are we so bold, to think we deserve something as good as you? 

I know an angel
Sent here for me...
