Well i want you to notice
to notice when i'm not around
and i know that your eyes see straight through me
and speak to me without a sound


i want to hold you
protect you from all of the things that this liife has in store for you
i'll always love you
the way that a father should love his daughter

when i walked out this morning
i cried as i walked to the door
i cried about how long i'd be away for
i cried about leaving you all alone


sweet zoe jane [x2]

so i wanted to say this
cuz i wouldn't know where to begin
to explain to you what i have been through
to explain where your daddy has been
