And you, bring me to my knees again
All the times that I've had to beg you please,
in vain
All the pain that I had to endure 
for you
Try so hard, let myself be shook

I know I'm on the outside and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the time that I fell in my face for you
Can't explain why I couldn't see the trace 
of you
Pushing through from behind
Your facade, I was blind
And I feel like I was so unsure

But I know that I'm on the outside and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All my joy, all my pain.
Striped away once again
And I feel so afraid of the enemies that I've made
And I can't break this pain
Can't escape it, you're to blame
And I know that life could be so pure with you

But I'm on the outside and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

'Cause I'm on the outside and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you
