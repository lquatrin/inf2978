I feel nothing
Longing for something
Relax take a minute to take your clothes off show me what your made of
Drugs
To sooth me

All Alone
Leave me here I'm dying
All Alone
Just kick me in the face
All Alone
All alone and trying
All Alone
I Suffocate

I'm not gifted
Slightly twisted
Try hard; try harder just to see if I can push you any further
Drugs
To soothe me

Please believe, You save me rearrange me
I can feel, You're feelings running through me
Take away, My sorrow, my tomorrow
Cradle me

Suffocate
