your mother came up to me
she wanted answers only she should know
only she should know..

it wasn't easy to deal
with the tears that rolled down her face
i have no answers cause
i didn't even know you

but these words
they can't replace
the life you..
the life you waste

how could you paint this picture
was life as bad as it should seem
that there were no more options for you

i can't explain how i feel
i've been there many times before
i've tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me

but these words
they can't replace
the life you..
the life you waste

did daddy not love you
or did he love you just too much
did he control you
did he live through you at your cost
did he leave no questions for you
to answer on your own

well fuck that
and fuck her
and fuck him
and fuck you
for not having the strength
in your heart
to pull through
i've had doubts
i have failed
i've fucked up
i've had plans
doesn't mean
i should take
my life
with my own hands

but these words
they can't replace
the life you..
the life you waste

but these words
they don't replace
the life you..
the life you waste
