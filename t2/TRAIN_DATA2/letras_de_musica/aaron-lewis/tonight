just try to understand this isn't what i planned
this ride's out of my hands
so now i'm forced to be something i can not be
if only i could make you see


tonight i'm alive
i've watched you all grow up and so have i
inside this isn't really what i had in mind
i no longer relate to this world of hate
that's forced upon my plate
i tend to disagree, i hope its not just me,
alone if only i could make you see

[chorus (x3)]
