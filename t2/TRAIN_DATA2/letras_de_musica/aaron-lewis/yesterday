You don't know what you've put me through
it's okay, i've forgiven you
but in some way, hope it fucks with you
hope it fucks with you

[pre-chorus]
that i'm okay and i've made it through
i'll say no names, though i've wanted to
isn't it strange how it seems like...

yesterday, a boy and already afraid
locked deep inside, my place to hide
to hide from how you made me feel
and i wonder how's your brother
did he end up fucked up like me?
lost in himself, crying for help it's safe to say
i learned to live without a pride
just a shell, with me stuck on the inside
a prison, not a place to hide
not a place to hide

[pre-chorus]

[chorus (altered)]

yesterday, a boy and already afraid
locked deep inside, my place to hide
to hide from how you made me feel
and i wonder how's your brother
did he finally pull through like me?
finding himself, not needing help
i'd like to say
