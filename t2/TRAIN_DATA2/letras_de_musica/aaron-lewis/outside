Verse 1:
When you, bring me to my knees,
All this time, that i can beg you please,
All the times, that i've felt insecure,
And i leave, my burdens at the door

Chorus:

I'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you


Verse 2: (play like verse 1)
All this time, that i've felt like this won't end,
Was for you,
And i taste, but i could never have,
Is from you,
All those times, that i tried,
My intention, full of pride,
And i waste, more time than anyone

Chorus:

I'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you


Verse 3:
All the times, that i cried
All this wasted, it's all inside
And i feel, all this pain,
Stuffed it down, it's back again
And i lie, here in bed,
All alone, i can't mend
And i feel, tomorrow will be okay, but i know

Chorus:

That i'm on the outside
I'm looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
'cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you
