The pictures left with me won't fade
These images effect me every day
Cause of you I feel I don't deserve
The life I see in her
Just don't leave me...Raw

Inside I'm so cold
Inside I'm so cold

I've never been someone who knows
My choices haunt me everywhere I go
Finally did something right for myself
My life for you and no one else
Just don't leave me...Raw

I feel so cold
I can't take this

Raw
