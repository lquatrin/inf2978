Respect, Respect what is found
Respect should abound
Respect everything that you leave
I can't believe
Can't believe
And I, I can't believe
I can't believe all the travesty
Surrounding me, I, I want to flee
I want to flee from everything
In front of me I
Can't believe
Never again, trusted in you
Fuck everything that you think I should be
I stand, never again, never again
Can't believe
