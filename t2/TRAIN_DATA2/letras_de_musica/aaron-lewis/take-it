I feel like this won't go away
No matter how hard I try to
Squeeze my eyes shut so I can't see
The pain in you this pain in me - in me

But everything that I can
say to you won't help you
everything you need is right
in front of you - just take it

I know that I am really not here
To represent what I am not clear
About in my head sometimes I feel
Fucked up just like you do - like you do

Try to make it through the daily pain that you feel
maybe tomorrow won't be so bad
I know it 'cause - I once felt
that way nothing I could say
Made it go away I lived through this
I still feel this I just live for my tomorrow
Just make it go away, Just make it go away
She'll make it go away, She'll make it go away
