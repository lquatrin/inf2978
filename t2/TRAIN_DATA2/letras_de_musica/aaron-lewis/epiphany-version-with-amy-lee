(os dois)

Your words to me a just whisper
Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear

Ah, oh
Cos it's always raining in my head
Oh, oh
Forget all the things I should have said

(amy lee)

So I speak to you in riddles
Cos my words get in my way
I spoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away
Cos I can't take anymore of this
I want to come apart
And dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart
Oh, oh
Cos it's always raining in my head
Oh, oh
Forget all the things I should have said

(os dois)

I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention
Yet I always try to hide
Cos I talk to you like children
Though I don't know how I feel
But I know I'll do the right thing
If the right thing isn't feel
Cos it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said
