So let them say its wrong for me to love you
They could never feel the way that I do When we kiss
When we're close like this
They can't see inside my soul
They can't know the love we know
All they do is waste their time
They can never change my mind

Chorus:
It's what my heart says
That is what I listen to
It's what my heart feels
That tells me, tells me what to do
It's what my heart knows
That's the only, only truth I know is real
All I hear is what my heart says to me
What my heart says

Let them say that I'm a fool to fall so deeply
They will never ever be loved so completely
How can they even talk that way?
They can't see it through my eyes
They can't feel this love inside
All their words don't mean a thing
They can't change the way I feel

Chorus

And I have never felt so sure about anything
You are the one, the one that I need, yeah
It doesn't matter what they think
Or what they say
I'm loving you anyway
They can't change the way I feel

Chorus
