I hear you talk about your family life
I wish I knew just what that means
I guess my mother never loved my dad
And now I wear it on my sleeve

My sister called me just the other day
It felt so good to hear her voice
My problem is I don't have much to say
I guess she doesn't have a choice
And I'm sorry

Look at me
I'm so pathetic
Can't Believe
I'm just an addict
I never needed anyone to help me I begging you
To please come save me from myself
Save me from my...

My mother's always tried to change herself
She never learned to let things be
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up
Cause now she seems so fake to me
But I Love Her

You push me but I won't fall
I've been programmed to take it all
And shove it way down inside
Like my father

I'm so pathetic
Can't believe
I'm just an addict
I try to be
I'm failing at it
Life to me
Is just a habit

I hear you talk about your family life
I wish I knew just what that means
