I try to breathe
Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
the thought is too
Much to concieve

Pre:
I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became 'cause

Chorus:
I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt

I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface
I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

So where were you
When all this I was going through
You never took the time to ask me
Just what you could do

Pre

Chorus

I never meant to fade away (x2)

Chorus
