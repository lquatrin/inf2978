Another day inside my world
I'm married to you and this road
A road that never lets me sleep
And there's no way to escape
These demons I'm forced to keep

And then I find
You here
Through your eyes
Everything's clear
And I fall
Inside your arms
But I'm alone for now

I mean the best with what I say
It doesn't always sound that way
I never learned to work things out
Cause in my family all we ever seemed to do is shout

And then I find
You here
Through your eyes
Everything's clear
And I fall
Inside your Arms
But I'm alone for now
alone for now..

And I try to sleep
The drugs I take are killing me
I think of you
To ease my pain
but you're so far..

Now it's time to say goodbye..
I Love You Baby, Please don't cry

And then i find
You here
Through your eyes
Everything's clear
And I fall
Inside your Arms
But I'm alone for now
Alone for now
