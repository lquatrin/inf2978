watch me sufer
you''ll feel better
stick the needle in my vein
lost my feelings with my dealing
thoughts of onl you remains

fuck

rip and tear
in my dispair
agonizing over shit
feel the needle burn and tingle
my bad habits deal with it

chorus:
fuck
i will self destruct

my light has slowly faded
broken and degredated
suffocate in my sorrow
maby i''ll die tomorrow
this riot that i''ve sited
came to you uninvited
truth hurts when it''s in your face
are you afraid of it?

chorus

i will self destruch

i think i''m gonna snap

i self destruct my mind
i self destruct my world
i self destruct my life
