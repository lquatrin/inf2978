And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own 2 feet again
And it's been awhile
Since i could call you

And everything I can't remember
It's f***** up as it all may seem
The consequences that i render
I stretch myself beyond my pains

And it's been awhile
Since I couldn't say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I could say I loved myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone & f***** things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that sh** seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
It's f***** up as it all may seem
The consequences that i render
I've gone & f****** thing up again, again....

Why must I feel this waaaaay...
Just make this go awaaaaay...
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile
Since I could look @ myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
It's f***** up as it all may seem
I cannot blame this on my father, he did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
