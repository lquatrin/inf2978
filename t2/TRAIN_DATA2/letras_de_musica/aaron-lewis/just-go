I'm kinda numb
It's so distorted
You've left me here with
This damage that you've caused
My tortured faces
Those fucked up places
In my memories
None of them I've lost
But

I haven't been here long enough to know
Every time I feel this I just loose control
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful
I wish that this would just go

It's kinda sick
I feel so dirty
It's kinda tragic
I'm kinda insecure
But I know
That I'm not the only
One that can fix
Whatever's wrong I'm sure
But

I feel so numb
From all I've become
I'll take you down
I feel so down
I'm water while you drown
You're lifted while I'm down
I'm cancer in your womb
I'm the needle in your spoon
But
