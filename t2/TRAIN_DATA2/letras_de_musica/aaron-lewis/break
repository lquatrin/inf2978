I walk alone I am alone
I think alone or die alone
Don't think I can make it on my own
I think I'll need someone to SAVE ME
Such is life so sad but true
Kill everything that's close to you
Tried to decide what not to do
You know you cannot CONTROL ME

I think there's no point in
Going any further
Than I've gone already
Can't keep my head standing

Sadness every day for me
You can take that away from me
All the fuck **** inside my head ***** than I can TAKE
You push and push on me
You're gonna keep on pushing till I break

You think you control me
Have no change than hold me
Only think that saves me
Why says just my kill me
