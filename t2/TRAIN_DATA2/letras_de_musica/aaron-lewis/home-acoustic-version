Forced myself through another day 
Cant explain the way today 
Just fell upon like everything 
Right in my face 

And I tried to be the one 
I cant except it's all because of you 
I had to walk away 
From everything 

And Im afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when i'm gone 
And Im afraid to come back home 

Another sleepless night again 
Hotel rooms my only friend 
And friends like that just don't add up 
To anything 

And I tried so hard to be 
Everyhting that I sould never take away from you 
Cus I heard you say 

And Im afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when i'm gone 
And Im afraid to come back home 

I can not forgive 
I live with regret 
I can not forgive 
I live with regret 

I live through this 
I cant tsee through this 
I cant do this anymore 

Cus Im afraid to be alone 
Afraid you'll leave me when Im gone 
Im afraid to come back home 

Afraid you'll leave me when Im gone 
I just wish I was back home 
Home
