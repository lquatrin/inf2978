i light another cigarette
stop to think about it
come to no conclusions
take each step as it comes
hold no prisoners except myself
painful thoughts denied

chorus:
try to explain
my loss of words
fuck you i piss upon you all

my head is a barricade
filled with peaceful thoughts
with evil outcomes
no one understands
try to break the barrier
i see no outlet
no ones there to catch me when i fall
