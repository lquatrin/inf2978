The whole world is spinning inside my head
And the whole world is just going crazy
I don't know how to explain it
All that I know is that I'm thinking of you

Woke up to the ringing of a phone
Hoping nothing is wrong, hoping everything is fine
But to my surprise, you were gone in the blink of my eyes
Gone forever, leaving me with a hole in my heart

How did this happen and why did you go
I wish I were there for you when you needed me the most
I wish I could have done something more
I wish I could bring you back

I'm remembering all the things we did
And all of the things that we could have done
I remember when you could make me happy when I was sad
Now you're not here and I feel bad

I'm on my way to a big gig and can't stop thinking of that day

And I'm getting nervous right now
But you taught me not to fear
Because fear is only and emotion

How did this happen and why did you go
I wish I were there for you when you needed me the most
I wish I could have done something more
I wish I could bring you back

I'm at your funeral today
And I have something that I want to say
You were there for me and I was there for you
Now your time has come and we will miss you, now and forever

How did this happen and why did you go
I wish I were there for you when you needed me the most
I wish I could have done something more
I wish I could bring you back...
I wish I could bring you back
I only wish I could bring you back
