Is it me or my imagination? 
I feel uneasy with this crazysituation 
And nobody knows whereits leading to next 
All we can do is hope for the best 
Tese kind of things only happen in movies 
Its all fools gold all your diamondsand your rubies 
Theres no more books so lets write an new story 
Of passion and joy and looking for glory 

Chorus 
Everwhere that you go 
I`m coming too 
Anywherethat you lead 
I follow you 
Gotta feeling we 
That we`re gonna be alright 
I know that it will 

Anything that you want 
I`ll see in through 
Anyplace that you`ve seen 
I`ll be there too 
Gotta feeling we 
That we`re gonna be alright 
alright 

We`ve been full circle we`ve gone roun and round 
The twists and turns all the ups and downs 
We can get what we want if we just understand 
Everthind we do is in our own hands 
Gotta get ahead and find a new solution 
Work together that`s our resolution 
Gotta be one voice that`s on the attack 
We gotte go forward never loock back 

Chorus
