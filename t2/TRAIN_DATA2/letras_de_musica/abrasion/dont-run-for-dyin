Some people dying
Blood on my hands
Just living crying
I don't understand
Maybe tomorrow
I might see the truth
Night full of strangers
And you're a mortal fool

Don't run for dying
I won't fight
Killing the people
I can't see the light

How many fears
Please leave me alone
After the dying i can feel so strong
Angels of darkness killing my mind
The tears of the dying walk by my side

Some people fighting hearing that voice
Just living crying they have no choice
Maybe tomorrow i might find the sky
Village of sorrow i wont look behind
