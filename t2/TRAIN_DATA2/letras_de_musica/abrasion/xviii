This is the time
You want your freedom
You want to fly
Fly for no reason
Watch out my friend
Look at your side
You need to play
The game of the life

Don't let your life
Be divided
Before and after a simple number
Find your conscience
And get your freedom
Don't be another slave to eighteen, the number

Now you can drive
So drive far away
But you will find
Stones in the way
Now is the time
To break all the rules
But you need to fight
To follow the rules
