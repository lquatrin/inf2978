It's the time to reach for power
But the light's so far away
If you want to get to heaven
Her's the chance again
Time is passing, passing by
But your eyes can see the way
Run to your paradise
Make it part of your day

Time is not over
Life goes on
Come on soldier, soldier carry on

It's the time to face your fears
It's the time to live your dreams

Clean all your bloody tears
And sing the glorious hyms
You may commit your sins
There's always someone to forgive
I know you want some peace
But this war you can't leave
