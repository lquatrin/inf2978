Power of creation
Ruller of perfection
Wizard of all nations
Heart and soul you claim
Screaming in the madness
You make it go away
I'm dreaming with the sadness
You break a mellow day

You're wizard and master
Nothing i can say
Time with you moves faster
When your spells fill the day

YouÂ´re merlin's apprentice
A knower of the ways
Spices, lotions, herbs and potions
Filling up my days
I'm your metal lover
You're princes of the night
I knew before your power
Awesome with its might

My wizard and master
No much more i can say
Hearts will beat much faster
When love fills up the day
