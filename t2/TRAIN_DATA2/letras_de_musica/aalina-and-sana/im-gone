So often that i cant describe the pain you've given me
So often that I cant tell you how i feel
But you know i've tried you know i've worked so hard
But you still decide to go
And you still decide to leave

No matter how much I try
No matter how much I do
It's never good enough enough for you

CHORUS
So this is it I'm leaving goodbye
Dont even bother coming after me
Im gone
