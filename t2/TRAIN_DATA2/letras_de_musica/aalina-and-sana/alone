She became a queen
And she had everything
But in turn, she wasnt happy

She was left inside
Oh but a lonely room
With nothing to do

Chorus
She was alone
Yet she had so many friends
She was alone

And she wanted to make amends

Too roo roo too too do do
Too roo roo too too do do

Until her teen years she was a happy qween
Never got into trouble never did a sin
