Don't wanna close the door,
Don't wanna give up on it
Don't wanna fight no more,
We'll find the way around it
Where's the love we had?
We can make it last

CHORUS
Tell me what I gotta be,
Tell me what you wanna do
'Cause I can't live my life
The way you want me to
You know I can't go on
Living like we do
Do I have to cry for you?
Do I have to cry for you?

So tell me what it's for,
If there's no winner in it?
Nobody's keeping score,
Let's start from the beginning
Can we make it last
Where's the love we had?

CHORUS

Do I gotta stay in the cold of night
Till the morning light, yeah
Do I have to say
I will let you get away

What I gotta be,
Tell me what you wanna do
I can't live my life
The way you want me to
You know I can't go on
Living like we do
Do I have to cry for you?
Yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh no

You know I can't go on
Living like we do
Do I have to cry for you?
Do I have to cry for you?
