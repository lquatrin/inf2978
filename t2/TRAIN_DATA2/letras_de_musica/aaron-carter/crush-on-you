You found out
Kick it

You found out i've got a crush on you

You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talking when she should be listening
Can't keep a secret to save my life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside
I never knew a rumour could spread so fast
But now the word is out all over town
That I'm longing for you

How did you know cos I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Maybe I was the one who left a trace
Was there a message written on my face
Were my emotions so easily read
That you could know my thoughts before a word was said
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control
Because the way you moved was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

How did you know cos I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Kick it
One time
Get it up
Get down

How did you know cos I never told
You found out
No more charades my heart's been displayed
You found out

How did you know cos I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

You found out I've got a crush on you

You found out I've got a crush on you
