I'm not too young and I'm not too old

Listen up everybody this ain`t Aaron's party

Part two and up now come and show me body

Girl what you gonna do come and talk

To me in the backseat, Baby Backstreet

We can surf the boardsurf the net, Yeah

And better yet we can make a little bet

If we get together yo it's gonna be the bomb

Ah hit me up baby AaronCarter.com

See when it comes to girls I'm not too young

Ah me? Baby face, back upon the seat

But when I get in trouble yo I'm not too old

I pull my cap way down and say I'm eleven years old

Thats how we roll



**CHORUS**

Get your hands up now

Let the music take control, This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm not too old

Here we go!

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control, This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old



It's the A to the A to the R O N

I'm all grown up now, run and tell your friend

It's all sewn up now, were do i begin ?

Don't even playa hate tryin to say I look 10

I'm tellin you again, I`ll wind up in the video,

catch me in the studio

Thats my life bro!

It's in my blood, It ain`t my fault.

You wanna step to me?

We can take it to the asfault.

Shoot some hoops, kid, Slam dunk the funk

Battle on the roller blades you callin me a punk?

Bring on the skateboards or the BMX

Show me what you got

Is that all? Please next..

I want the poetry, wheres the concentration?

Don't even talk about the Sony Play Station

I'll make it happen if it seems that you want

Aaron Carter got you open, dont front, dont front

Lets roll

**CHORUS**

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old

A here we go!

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old



He's steppin out with the older boys,

Cover up your ears cause we makin mad noise

He`s steppin out with the younger girls,

Cover up your eyes couse we rock the world (Repete)



So when it come to takin' all the girls for cruise in my ride

All I need my pillows, Hello

I`m not too young (do do do do)

My cellular wrong (do do do do)

Switch it off yo, hit me on my pager

A real teenager with a fake beard battin in the majors

Thats how we roll

And when it suits me

I'm anywhere between 12 and 18 years old

Here we go



**Chorus**

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old

A here we go!

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old

(cause we rock the world!)

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old

(cause we rock the world!)

Throw your hands up now, let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young and I'm too old
