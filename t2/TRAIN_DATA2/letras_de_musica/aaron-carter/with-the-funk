One, two three
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooo ohhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I threw a party would you be there
Would you bring your friends too
'cause why should we stay at home
With something better to do

Let's started in the house
And move it to the street
C'mon and follow me

And have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna pump
Bebop and body bump

Let's have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's too short
So c'mon get on board
And have some fun

We all need a permanent vacation
From the things that get us down
So turn it up and turn it out
'cause it can never get too loud

Let's take it from the street
And move it to the beach
There's sand beneath our feet

And have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna pump
Bebop and body bump

Let's have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's too short
So c'mon and get on board
And have some fun

There is no place I'd rather be
And it's no secret why
It would never mean as much to me
Without you by my side

One
Stop starring at the walls
Two
All you girls and boys
One
It's time to make some noise
Two

One, two, three
And have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna pump
Bebop and body bump

Let's have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's too short
So c'mon and get on board
And have some fun with the funk

Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna pump
Bebop and body bump

Let's have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's too short
So c'mon and get on board
And have some fun with the funk
