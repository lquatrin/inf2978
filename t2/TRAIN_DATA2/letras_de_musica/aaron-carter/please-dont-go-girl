Please don't go girl

Please don't go girl

Please don't go girl



It would ruin my whole world

Tell me you'll stay

And never ever go away



I love you

I guess I always will

Girl

You're my best friend

Girl

You're my love within

I just want you to know

That I will always love you



Ooh baby

Please don't go stay with me

You're the only one that is right

For me

Tell me girl that you'll stay

I don't ever want to see you go away



Tell me you'll stay

Never ever go away

I need you

I guess I always will

CHORUS



Ooh baby

Please don't go girl

I'm gonna love you girl



I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time

Tell me girl that you'll always be mine



Please don't go girl You would ruin my whole world

Tell me you'll stay and neverever go away

CHORUS



Ooh baby

Please don't go girl

Please don't go girl

Please don't go girl
