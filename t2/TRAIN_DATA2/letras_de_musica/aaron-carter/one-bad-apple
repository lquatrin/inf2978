I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face, girl
Some guy brought safety to your happy world
You need love but you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And break your heart again

Chorus
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on love
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I don't care what you've heard

I could make you happy babe and satisfy you too
But why won't you give me a chance to prove my love to you
Won't you just give me just one little chance
I give you love thats guaranteed you won't be hurt again

Chorus
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on love
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I don't care what you've heard

I've been noticing you babe for a long, long time
I'm not ashamed to tell the world that you really messed up my world
Girl, to me you're like a dream come true
I'd rather hurt myself than to ever hurt you

Chorus (Till Fade)
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on love
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I don't care what you've heard
