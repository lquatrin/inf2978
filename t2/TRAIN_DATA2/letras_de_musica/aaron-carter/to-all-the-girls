Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
Na Na, NaNaNa Na
Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
Let me break down

I remember sunny days
Chillin' at the beach and catchin' rays
Shelled-toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere

Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin' Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do

Growin' up can be so strange, but some thing's will neverchange
To all the girls that had my back, I'm with you and it's likethat

Chorus 
To all the girls who sing along with me
To all the girls to where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down for me
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me


Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
Na Na, NaNaNa Na (being good to me)
Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
I wanna thank you for being goo to me

Sometimes I sit and reminisce
Of all the hot girls that I miss
Tank tops with the low-cut jeans
All the guys know what I mean
Hip-hop style, the retro rock
All the girls that's on my block
You've been down with me since one
And we've only just begun

Growin' up can be so strange, but some thing's will neverchange
To all the girls that had my back, I'm with you and it's likethat

Chorus 
To all the girls who sing along with me
To all the girls to where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down for me
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me


Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
Na Na, NaNaNa Na (being good to me)
Na Na, NaNaNa Na Na
I wanna thank you for being goo to me

Come on 
Jump jump
Come on
Jump jump

Let me hit you with one more
Maybe I'll see you out on tour
And we could do it all again
-Until then

Chorus 
To all the girls who sing along with me (come on)
To all the girls to where I wanna be (jump jump)
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see (jump jump)
To all the girls that held it down for me (come on)
To all the girls that gave me memories (oh yeah)
I wanna thank you for being good to me (yeah, yeah)


Chorus 
To all the girls who sing along with me (to all my girls)
To all the girls to where I wanna be (all my girls)
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down for me (yeah)
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
