Girl, I know what you're thinkin'
Need some answers in you're heart, tonight
Girl, I'm here, to make it different
It's the precious sweetness of your life

Let hair down, Let your guard down
Let me show you everything, you've been missing
Let it all go, girl you're gonna let it flow
Don't let the door close
I know what can get you better

Chorus 
You need some sugar
You're only human, baby
Let me bring it on to you, tonight
I'll be your sugar
I'm gonna make it easy
Prove that I can make you feel so right

Girl, love doesn't have to be
A big deal for you, time and again
Girl, take a look at the big picture
There's a new star in my head

Let hair down, Let your guard down
Let me show you everything, you've been missing
Let it all go, girl you're gonna let it flow
Don't let the door close
I know what can get you better

Chorus 
You need some sugar
You're only human, baby
Let me bring it on to you, tonight
I'll be your sugar

Going through it
I come to you
Just a kiss

I'm not leavin'
You this way
That's why you hear me say

Chorus 
You need some sugar
You're only human, baby
Let me bring it on to you, tonight
I'll be your sugar
I'm gonna make it easy
Prove that I can make you feel so right

You need some sugar
You're only human, baby
Let me bring it on to you, tonight
I'll be your sugar
I'm gonna make it easy
Prove that I can make you feel so right
