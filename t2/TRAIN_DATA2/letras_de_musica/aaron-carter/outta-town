I'm still young, getting older by the minute
Reaching out to the millions, believe it
I work hard, I work fast
Imma take it to the top and i'm gonna laugh
I know what I've got, so stop
Knocking on my wagon, cause I'm blowing up spots
Been 'round the world more times than phillius frog
And wherever I go, I get mad love!

To the east to the west
To the north To the south
They know AC and they know I get down..
To the east, to the west
To The north, To the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that


Ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town
Cause ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town 

I'm not the type of guy who shows off for attention
About the fancy cars and jewels
But let me mention
Girls can't get enough of me
Record company lovin me
Jealousy from all other guys?
hmm.. probably
But that won't get in my way
It ain't stopping me
Always reach for the top, that's how it's gotta be
Don't worry 'bout the people that hmm.. take a pop of me
So on with the show, hit the road, here we go!


To the east to the west
To the north, To the south
They know AC and they know I get down..
To the east to the west
To The north, To the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that

Ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town
Cause ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town


Now wait, people wanna know about the way I live
And do my biz
This bright young kid, 
works hard just to make these hits
But, never the less, they try to attack me
Just to make me react
But Specters got my back 
So come on mama we're strong
My label's got the ball rollin they come correct
From hip hop to pop, go look at, check


From the east to the west
To The north, To the south
They know A.C. and they know I get down..
From the east, to the west
To The north, To the south
Keep my feet on the ground and they know that


Ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town
Cause ya don't see me braggin'
But then you wanna come and take a knock at my wagon
Giddy up, giddy up
And hold up, take a look around
Then roll out, roll it outta town
