I lay awake, thinking of you. 
Wondering why I do the things I do. 
How could I let your love escape. 
When all I do is waittttt..... 
I can't stop. Your love is still there. 
The ghost of you, comes to my mind everywhere. 
I find a way to make it right and someday soon I'll get you back in 
my life. 
Faces Change.......... 
as time goes by...You'll see mine...but I won't change my mind. 
How can I stop time dreaming of.. 
I'll waitt....I'll wait..forever for your love... 
Forever for your love.... 

Lonely days....sleepless night..remembering why your touch felt tight. 
You'll be in my heart for alwaysss.. 
Things I hear...Nothing is always the same. 
I can't stop. Your love is still there. 
The gohost of you, comes to my mind everywhere. 
I find a way to make it right and someday soon I'll get you back 
every night... 

Faces Change... 
as time goes by...Youl'll see mine.. but I won't change my mind. 
How can I stop time dreaming of.. 
I'll wait....I'll wait..forever for you love.... 
Forever for your love...
