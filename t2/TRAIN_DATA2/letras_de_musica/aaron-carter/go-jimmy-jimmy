Jimmy
Jimmy who?
Neutron, Neutron, Neutron

Here we go
Verse one

I flip the switches
In the atomosphere
In my drop top market
Doin' my ten
I'm a little shootin'
Star in the makin'
Droppin' Neutron bombs
Never fakin'
Cuz I'm headin' for the top
No mistakin'
And my destiny's mine
For the takin'
?????
Like a black hole
Wanna act up
I'm a big shot
Make a big move
Comin' up
Take control of my life
Like a spaceship
But I still keep it
Real with my parents
Don't lip, won't trip
While I'm on Earth
When I'm in the
Milky Way
Just trust, givin' up
Ain't an option
Where I'm goin'
Ain't no man ever been
Light speed, light years
I'm ahead of them

Go Jimmy Jimmy
That's the voice I hear inside
Everybody let's bounce
Straight up come along for the ride
Go Jimmy Jimmy
To the rescue
Through the big blue sky
Be back before I leave
It's Jimmy Neutron time

No time for jittering
It's my turn
At bat like Robin
Since I'm in
The big leagues
No stoppin'
Like a comet
On a mission
I'm movin'
Cuz I'm doin' my thing
Out lookin' for the big bang
Do you wanna hang?
Make a decision
How are you livin'?
Don't be a quitter
I'm gonna fly
Forget about physics
Gravity mean nuthin' to me
Work can't stop me
Is it just me?
Hold me back
Yeah right, let's see
Whatever I say
I trust I'll be
So let's ride out, slide out
On a sunbeam
Time ain't nuthin'
When ya got big dreams
It's your world, universe
Woooweee
Split them atoms
Blow the scene

Go Jimmy Jimmy
That's the voice I hear inside
Everybody let's bounce
Straight up come along for the ride
Go Jimmy Jimmy
To the rescue
Through the big blue sky
Be back before I leave
It's Jimmy Neutron time

Uh, do your thing
Uh, do your thing
Uh, do your thing
Anything goes down 'round here
Uh, do your thing
Uh, do your thing
Uh, do your thing

You know I got to make you dance

Go Jimmy Jimmy
That's the voice I hear inside
Everybody let's bounce
Straight up come along for the ride
Go Jimmy Jimmy
To the rescue
Through the big blue sky
Be back before I leave
It's Jimmy Neutron time

Go Jimmy Jimmy 2x
That's the voice I hear inside
Everybody let's bounce
Straight up come along for the ride
Go Jimmy Jimmy
To the rescue
Through the big blue sky
Be back before I leave
It's Jimmy Neutron time
