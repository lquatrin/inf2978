The goose drank wine

The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line

The line broke, the monkey got choked

and they all went to heaven on a little row boat

Clap pat - clap pat - clap pat - clap slap

Clap Pat! Clap you hand....

Pat it on your partners hand.. right hand

Clap pat! Clap you hand...

Cross it with your left arm

Pat your partner left palm

Clap slap! Clap your hand...

Slap your thigh and sing a little song



My momma told me if I was lucky

that she would treat me

If i was goody

My Aunty told her, I shoulda told her

No i'm not kidding

That's what she told her

The goose drank wine

The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line

The line broke, the monkey got choked

And they all went to heaven on a little row boat



Clap! Clap!

Clap your hands and prepare to pat

Take your right arm

Pat your partner palm with your right palm



Clap!

Take your hand back and clap

Clap!

Take your right arm

Cross your right arm with your left arm

Pat your partner left palm with your left palm

Clap!

Now back with a clap

Take your hand with your palm and slap your thigh

And watch the fun materialize

As we sing this little song:



My momma told me if I was lucky

That she would treat me

If I was goody

My aunty told her, I shoulda told her

No i'm not kidding

That's what she told her



That's what she told her

I don't believe her

Yeah right

Can you believe it?
