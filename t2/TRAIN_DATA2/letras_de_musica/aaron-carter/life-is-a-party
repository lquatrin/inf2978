Hey,hey,hey,hey

Party Time

Give me the beat, 

Give it up

Put your hands from side to side

Here we go,



So people live for the weekend

Seems like such a waste

Counting down till the fun begins

What about the other days?



There's Monday night  (Monday night)

And Tuesday night (Tuesday night)

Wednesday, Thursday,

Why wait?

364 days!



(chorus)

Life is a party

Lets get it started 

Gettin started

Get it started tonight

Life is a party

Get excited, 

You're invited

Theres a party tonight



Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey



Imagine everyone in the world

Out in the streets at night

Everybody's gonna rock all day

Just 95 party time



Now in Brazil, (in Brazil)

Wanbei, Cairo, Puerto Rico

Now everybody lets go!



repeat chorus



Uh, Give me the beat (repeat)

All around the world

Every 24/7 gonna rock it girl
