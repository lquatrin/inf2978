My first ride
Wait outside
I'm steppin' inside
I don't really care, what everybody says
That a hot ride blows the girls away
Anyway, all I wanna do is drive, okay
Can't see, can't sleep, and uh, I can't wait
Any day, any day now
It's official
AC, I'ma place my initials
The little weasels, now I got diesel
I can hold the stearing wheel steady, get ready

Wait, I gotta refuel
Crank the track up
Now I'm grown up, so what's the hold up
I'm comin' through, with the system blastin'
Bangin' my head, always blastin'
Watch me (ooh)
Ride 'til the tank is empty (ooh)
Anywhere I wanna go, don't tempt me (ooh)
I wanna roll to the Hoop, in the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'
Catch me (ooh)
Or you're gonna be left lonely (ooh)
In the dust of the one and only (ooh)
Can't hold me, control me
When I'm ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
Ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
Ridin', ridin', ridin
Trouble burn, rubber burn
It's my turn
So here when you cross the road, my concern
Feels like formula 1, but oh no
I'm being pulled over by the 1-5-0
(Woo, Woo) What the deal, yo, uh
Officer, tell me, what's the problemo
You were driving way to slow
You gotta do 60, you were doing 4-0
Let me see your driver's license, and registration
I don't need one, it's Aaron's Alien Nation
It's just Carter, here we go, then I laugh
If you let me off
I'll write your daughter an autograph
Then he laughed, and said 'sure', uh uh
Give me your ticket, he said boy, look, uh
Get outta here before I lose my cool
And act like a driver
You know the rules
Watch me (ooh)
Ride 'til the tank is empty (ooh)
Anywhere I wanna go, don't tempt me (ooh)
I wanna roll to the Hoop, in the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'
Catch me (ooh)
Or you're gonna be left lonely (ooh)
In the dust of the one and only (ooh)
Can't hold me, control me
When I'm ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
Ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
Ridin', ridin', ridin
Slow down
My first ride
I'm steppin' inside
Watch me (ooh)
Ride 'til the tank is empty (ooh)
Anywhere I wanna go, don't tempt me (ooh)
I wanna roll to the Hoop, in the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'
Catch me (ooh)
Or you're gonna be left lonely (ooh)
In the dust of the one and only (ooh)
Can't hold me, control me
When I'm ridin', ridin', ridin
Watch me (ooh)
Ride 'til the tank is empty (ooh)
Anywhere I wanna go, don't tempt me (ooh)
I wanna roll to the Hoop, in the Bentley
Ridin', ridin', ridin'
Catch me (ooh)
Or you're gonna be left lonely (ooh)
In the dust of the one and only (ooh)
Can't hold me, control me
When I'm ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
Ridin', ridin', ridin
uh uh ah uh ah uh uh ah ah uh
