Bounce!
I wanna see you bounce!
Welcome to the party, this is one of a kind.
Like a hot chilly pepper it'll blow your mind.
Don't no if you could take it, so now were gonna shake it.
And if you can't ditch it your in the house of reds.
It's like this we got a crazy notion.
The DJ's CD was a jumpy potion.
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air.
Were givin it uno, dos, thres.
Oh yeah...

You gotta get up, to get it down.
Come On
Come On
When the DJ's kicks in and you feel the swing, you just can't stand around.
You better get up, gonna funk around.
Come On
Come On
When you feel this thing let the fun begin.
Don't stop now 'cause I wanna see ya bounce!

Chorus
Livin it up cause were here to party.
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy.
Play the disco bongo with me.
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me.

Livin it up cause were here to party.
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy.
Play the disco bongo with me.
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me.

Come on
Come on
Stop the tracks,can't you see it's not enough
Cause the vine of bliss is come in tough.
They say "Turn it down!"
But ya say "No way!!"
Cause the sound is pumpin from the jigga-DJ!
Crank it up cause we gonna subside
Generation of Millenium
We gonna rock it
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air.
Were givin it uno, dos, thres.
Oh yeah...

You gota get up, to get it down.
Come On
Come On
When the DJ's kicks in and you feel the swing, you just can't stand around.
You better get up, gonna funk around.
Come On
Come On
When you feel this thing let the fun begin.
Don't stop now 'cause I wanna see ya bounce!

Chorus
Livin it up cause were here to party.
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy.
Play the disco bongo with me.
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me.

Livin it up cause were here to party.
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy.
Play the disco bongo with me.
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me.
