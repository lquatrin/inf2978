Baby since I saw you last
Good fortune's finally come my way
The lean days are a thing of the past
But it hasn't changed the way I feel
I can't imagine life without you
I want you to know
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
I've lived and learned a lesson in life
That money never buys you love
I cherish every moment in time
My mission's to make you mine
Every night I dreamt about you
Now I want to say
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
One thing I need
Baby that's you
I never stopped thinking about you
Kept a photograph next to my bed
You paint a picture when you smile
And I need to see, see it again
If I tried now, could I convince you?
I just got to say
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
I got all the things that money can buy
Got enough to enjoy the good life
But I want to say I'd give it away
For the one thing I need
One thing I need
Baby that's you
