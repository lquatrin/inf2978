Just when you thought it was safe...
Shake
Shake
Shake
When I hit town, yo, the party gets down
I'm hittin' 20, on the rictor scale
Got a hundred million people, spillin' coffee and stains
Got your brand new shirt
Oh, that reminds you of me

When you feel your gums flap, it's Aaron's rap
Watch yourself, I'ma rearange your map
We could hand shake, baby
You ain't getting old
It's only Aaron Carter here
To rock and roll!
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the shots at the girls I'll
Make, make, make
make 'em drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When the ?? drop, I'ma shake the foundation
Rock the formation
What's your reservation
Photos lying the walls, It's amazing
oh no, trouble with the bass vibrations
Race the impact, of my new track
Take cover, 'cause we're coming through like that
All the other, tracks sounds wickie wickie whack
It's 2 double 0-2 time to react
From the east, to the west
To the north, to the south
I'm hittin' every angle, shakin' every house
No doubt, uh uh
That's what I'm all about
I can't stop even if you scream and shout
Breakin' up your life like an earthquake, right?
Strap yourself in
Hold tight, hold tight
Watch your momma's china, fly like a kite
Shakin' up your life everyday and every night!
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the shots at the girls I'll
Make, make, make
make 'em drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
Ladies out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'
Fellas out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'
Ladies out in Cali say 'not another earthquake'
You are my friend, it's Aaron Carter again


Gotta move baby, because it hurts so good
Even with Novacane, you couldn't numb the pain
If your sleepin' again
I'ma shake you out of bed, or instead
Gonna shake the confetti for newly weds
There in the water, I never dead wrong
Comin' through the floor, can't stop my song
I bring bass like the makers
If you ain't playin' this party
I'll shake the whole station
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the shots at the girls I'll
Make, make, make
make 'em drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the shots at the girls I'll
Make, make, make
make 'em drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
When my joy hits, I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down, shake it down
Break it down, here we go
