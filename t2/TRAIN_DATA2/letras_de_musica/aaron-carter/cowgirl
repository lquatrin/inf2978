Chorus

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

Lil mama

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

Lil Mama

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

I met myself a cowgirl

What you want

Put me on

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

Lil mama

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

Lil mama

Yippy ki yo yippy yeh

I met myself a cowgirl

What you want

Put me on



OK this is how it went down

Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the playground

Chillin,

My father honked his horn at me

Said I had a show in Texas and I gotta leave

Texas, WOW! I've never been

Maybe I can find a new hang out friend

Anyway

Packin up my bags on the way

Signin autographs as I run to catch the plane

I seen her

Chubby cheeks with long braids, cute face, same age

She was playin hard to get

As I offered her my name she just walked away

With a smile

Oh my little cowgirl



Chorus



OK

Now the plane landed

Shes been on my mind so much I cant stand it

My manager kept rushing me to go

I try to look for her

I give her tickets to the show

(Hey Aaron c'mon)

Thought I see a cowboy hat

But everyone was ready and our luggage was packed

(Lets go)

Hesitent for leaving my heaven sent cowgirl

We went off to the hotel,

As I practice in the hotel lobby

She was on my mind full  time

The fellas tryin to cheer me up

I come down with a case of puppy love

(Oh Aaron you'll be alright)

I went back to havin fun

Dancin makes you thirsty

Plus it was time for lunch at the hotel restaurant

Order me some burgers and fries

Then to my surprise walked in my cowgirl



Chorus



Go go hey

Break it down little lady

Go go go

Break it down little lady

Go go

Break it down

I met myself a cowgirl

What you want

Put me on

Go go

Break it down little lady

Go go

Break it down little lady

Go

Break it down

I met myself a cowgirl

What you want

Put me on



And now Im on the stage

Performing in front of a capacity

Screaming guys

And screaming girls

But still no sign of my cowgirl

As I head to the other front part of the stage

There she stood

With a smile on her face

My cowgirl

Took her by the hand

Pulled her onstage

And I started to dance with my cowgirl



~Chorus~
