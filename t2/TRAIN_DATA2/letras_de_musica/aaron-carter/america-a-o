U...S-A
Bang your heads to this, come on
U...S-A
Bang your heads to this 
Chorus 
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America, A O
A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America, A O
A O, A O, A O
Come on
Does that sound a little serious to you
Has Aaron Carter turned red, white, and blue
I've been rollin' like this since day one
But I never bring it on your face, I have fun
There's a time to get down
And a time to clown around
Right about now time fix the frown
Face to face and body to body
We're gonna pull through
Come on, everybody
Trouble times bring about trouble vibes
I cheer you up, baby
Let me clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere inbetween
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dream
Chorus 
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America, A O
A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America, A O
A O, A O, A O
Come on

It's where I'm from, and where I'm at
IÂ’m feelin' proud, and I got it like that
It ainÂ’t a dis, so donÂ’t take it like that
The grass ainÂ’t greener
Uh uh, forget that
From the valleys, to the hills, to the sun
All the friends and the fam
I'll let you know
Everybody come together
Make it half black, white, Spanish, Chinese
Show me what you got, uh
Trouble times bring about trouble vibes
I cheer you up, baby
Let me clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere inbetween
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dream
Chorus 
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America, A O
A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America, A O
A O, A O, A O
Come on

U...SA
Bang your heads to this, come on
U...(everybody) S-A
Bang your heads to this
U...(every last state) S-A
Bang your heads to this, come on
U...(come on) S-A
Bang your heads to this
Chorus 
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America, A O
A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America, A O
A O, A O, A O

Come On
Chorus 
I was born, I was raised
In the US of A
I'm livin' in America, A O
A O, A O, A O
And no matter what they say
I'll be livin' here anyway
I'm lovin' you America, A O
A O, A O, A O
