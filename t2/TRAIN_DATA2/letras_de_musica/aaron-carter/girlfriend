Hey Girl, I'm sad
I heard that you're leaving
You can't go, you're my bestfriend
I'm sure gonna miss you

I always think about you
All the time you're on my mind
We played together you and I
I can't believe that its true
Now I have to see you leave
You're the only one for me

My girlfriend, my bestfriend
I don't wanna see you go
I just wanna let you know that
I have a crush on you
I can't wait no longer girl
To say what I feel

I'm gonna miss you forever
I'm gonna miss you girl
Gonna miss you girl
(2x)

The first time that I saw you
I knew it from the very start
You had a place deep in my heart
I can't believe that it's true
Now it's time for you to leave
And Baby I just can't believe

I'm gonna miss you forever
I'm gonna miss you girl
Gonna miss you girl
(2x)

You and me together
Girl, I'll wait forever
It's only the matter of time
'Coz I never wanna see you go
I just wanna let you know
That I can't wait no longer girl
To say what I feel

I'm gonna miss you forever
I'm gonna miss you girl
Gonna miss you girl
(2x)

I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss you...
