Gonna make a connection
'Cause I know I got take 'em high
And I'll show you how to whip up a kicker
If that's alright
But you gotta wait around in the half pipe
There's something 'bout the look in your eye
Hey girl, why don't you show me a trick or two
And it let it fly
Gonna twist down, gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get along, gonna get along fine
I got the skills, if you got the style
You do it for me, it's the way you smile, girl
Take people home, to a hip hop beat
Knock me down, help me off my feet
Whip one up, and get on the with the show
Ooh, You know the way to go
It's to good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's to good to be true
Nananana nananana
Nananana na nananana
Okay, it's not like I'm short of a girlfriend(Yeah right)
But I'm playing with my plan of attack
'Cause I know that once she's checked out my lfip-slide
Ain't lookin' back
Gonna twist down, gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get along, gonna get along fine
I got the skills, if you got the style
You do it for me, it's the way you smile, girl
Take people home, to a hip hop beat
Knock me down, help me off my feet
Whip one up, and get on the with the show
Ooh, you know the way to go
It's to good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's to good to be true
I ride all day, even in the sun Boilin' hot, but I still havefun
Everybody's watchin', keepin' an eye on
How I skate, how I fly
Ridin' the rails, hittin' the ramps
I'll skate all day, gonna have to camp
Although I get tired, it doesn't stop me
Hey, you better watch me
Gonna twist down, gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get along, gonna get along fine
I got the skills, if you got the style
You do it for me, it's the way you smile, girl
Take people home, to a hip hop beat
Knock me down, help me off my feet
Whip one up, and get on the with the show
ooh, You know the way to go
It's to good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
I don't want to come back down
It's to good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's to good to be true
Nananana nananana
Nananana na nananana
Nananana nananana
Nananana na nananana
And I don't wanna come back down
It's to good to be true
