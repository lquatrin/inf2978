Uptown girl,
Shes been living in her uptown world,
I bet she never had a backstreet guy,
I bet her mama never told her why,
Im gunna try,
(chorus)
For an uptown girl,
Shes been living in her white bred world,
As long as anyone with hot looking,
And now shes looking for a down town man, thats what i am!
And when she knows what she wants from her time,
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind, she'll say im not so tough,
Just because,
Im in love!
With an uptown girl, shes been living in her uptown world,
Im getting tired of her high class toys,
And all her presents from her uptown boys,
Shes got a choice!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uptown girl, u know i cant afford to buy her pearls,
But maybe someday when my ship comes in,
She'll understand what kind of guy ive been,
And then ill win.
And when shes walking, shes looking so fine,
And when shes talking, she'll say that shes mine.
She'll say im not so tough, just because, im in love.
(chorus)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uptown girl, shes my uptown girl x2
Im in love with an uptown girl, shes my uptown girl x2
