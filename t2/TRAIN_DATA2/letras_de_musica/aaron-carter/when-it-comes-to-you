Oh yeah (oh yeah)

Six thirty mama gets you out of bed
You E-mail what you're gonna wear to you girlfriend
You skip you Breakfast, forget your backpack
When you're half way you run back
You're daddy's angel with a halo
Everybody's looking at you more like a J. Lo
There is so much more to you

So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
What you wanna know now baby

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
And what your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through no
When it comes to you

Now, your middle name is August
But I remember you were born in November
You lived in Jersey but you from Ontario
Your twin sisters like to talk in stereo
We've got so much in common
Like Jane & Reeds with lots of bottom
But there's so more we could do

So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you wanna know now baby

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through no
When it comes to you
When it comes to you

I want you to know
Baby I've been studying
Pulling all nighters
When I could've been partying
I can't fail
It's in the details
Understanding all that which is female
Some guys don't ever see what they're missing
Talking about themselves when they should be listenin'
I pay attention to things you say to me
When it comes to you
It's in my memory

When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through no

When it when it when it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What you what your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through no
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
