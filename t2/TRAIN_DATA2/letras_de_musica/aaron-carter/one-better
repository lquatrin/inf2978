Give me half the chance
IÂ’ll make you understand
That what I got to give
Is so much more than this 
Than you'll ever know

I donÂ’t say whatÂ’s on my mind
But youÂ’ll find this out in time
DonÂ’t always open up
IÂ’m not quick to trust
And let someone inside

IÂ’ve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say whatÂ’s right for me

You should know that I can 
Be more than you will ever need
IÂ’ll show you something new to see, yeah
IÂ’ll be the one you can believe
IÂ’ll be one better, Yeah
IÂ’ll be one better

YouÂ’ve seen some falling stars
You felt a broken heart
Time is all it takes 
Learn from my mistakes
Know exactly what you are
But I canÂ’t hang on the side
IÂ’ve had enough of all these fights
Gotta give to you
Gotta get this through

Till you realize
IÂ’ve got a lot to learn
Never felt this way before
But I gotta say whatÂ’s right for me

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
IÂ’ll show you something new to see (yeah)
IÂ’ll be the one you can believe
IÂ’ll be one better, Yeah

I wont back down (No never, No never)
You donÂ’t have to be alone 
Girl, Alone (Oooh, Ooh) No (Oh)

You should know that I can
Be more than you will ever need
IÂ’ll show you something new to see
I'll be the one you can believe
IÂ’ll be one better (Oh)
(IÂ’ll be)
IÂ’ll be one better (Oh)
(IÂ’ll will)
IÂ’ll be one better (Oh)
