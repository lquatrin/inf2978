Here's a little bit old school for ya
That goes a little something like this.....

I always try to be the flyest kid on the block
The popular one with the rising stop
So that's when I had this bright idea
(throw the party of the month?)
nah the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I got to do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie (no, send them to a show)
let me think hmmm, it's gotta be long though
I said mom and dad yo, why you sitting home
It's a friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about staying out to long
Don't fuss over me,
I'll be fine alone (*car leaving*, beep beep)
Have a good time
The doorbell rings, cause the party's here
I am cranking up the stereo like it's new years
Walking round' the house like who's
the man
Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can
(First on the floor)
you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's mtv
I guess I am wearing long, cause I lost my head
I jumped on the table and this is what I said

CHORUS
People all around you got to
(come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it)
Jump all around come on
(come get it)
What?
(come get it)
say it again
(come get it)
People all around you got to
(come get it)
From the left to the right make noise
(come get it)
Here we go now come on
(come get it)huh (come get it)
huh what what what (come get it)
na na na na
na na na na
na na na na
yeah yeah yeah yeah (come get it, come and get it!)

Things are going great then to my surprise
Some people walked in I didn't reconize
I said fellas yo you gotta get out
(Hey man, I heard this was an open house)
Open house? (yeah, that's what the flyers said)
I didn't put out flyers (Well, somebody did)
Then walked in the girl I am crushing
Then the kid spilled juice on my mom's new cushions
I turned around another kid broke a lamp
(I hope they weren't expensive)They got them from France
But for now I won't sweat it, I'll clean it up later
There's a hunny over there and I really want to meet her

CHORUS
People all around you got to
(come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it)
Jump all around come on
(come get it)
What?
(come get it)
say it again, here we go huh
(come get it)
People all around you got to
(come get it)
From the left to the right make noise
(come get it)
Here we go now come on
(come get it)huh (come get it)
huh what what what (come get it)
na na na na (ac's in the house)
na na na na
na na na na
yeah yeah yeah yeah (come and get it!)

Break it down (go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
(now the real trouble starts)
is that the car door? oh dang, I am in trouble
Everyone get out now on the double
I am dead (your done)
That's it for me
I am gonna be picked off my family tree,
once mom finds out bout' this party I had
I don't even want to start thinking of my dad
I am husseling around the house trying to clean the mess
I sure to put my new white nikes to the test
The car door slams as their walking up the steps
I guess life was good, there's 10 seconds left....
AARON!!!!
Grounded

CHORUS
People all around you got to
(come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it)
Jump all around come on
(come get it)
What?
(come get it)
say it again
(come get it)
People all around you got to
(come get it)
From the left to the right make noise
(come get it)
Aaron C's in the house, come on
(come get it)huh (come get it) what what,
come with it (come get it)
na na na na (ha ha)
na na na na (what what, come on)
na na na na (come on with it, come on)
yeah yeah yeah yeah (come get it, come get it)
(come get it)
