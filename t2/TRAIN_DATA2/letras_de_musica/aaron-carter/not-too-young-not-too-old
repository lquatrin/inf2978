Not Too Young, Not Too Old



I'm not too young, not too old

Listen up everybody

This ain't Aaron's party

Part two, I'm older now

Come and show me body

Girl, whatcha gonna do

Come and talk to me in the backseat

Baby backstreet

We could surf the board

Surf the net, better yet

We could make a little bet

If we get together, yo, it gonna be da bomb

Hit me all baby, Aaron Carter dot com

See when it comes to girls

I'm not too young

Baby face back up on the seat

But when I get in trouble

Hey, I'm not to old

I pull my cap way down

and say I'm eleven years old

That how we roll

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young, not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young, I'm not too old

It A to the A to the R O N

I'm all grown up now

Running to your friend

It's all sewn up now

Where do I begin?

Don'y even playa hate

Trying to say I look ten

I'm not telling you again

I'm all up in da video

Catch me in the studio

That my life bro. Its in my blood

Hey, it ain't my fault

You wanna step to me

We can take it to the asfault

Shoot some hoops can

Slam dunk the funk

Battle on the rollerblades

You calling me a punk?

Bring on the skateboards

Or the BMX. Show me what you got

Is that all? Please, next

I'll wipe the floor with you

Where the concentration

Don't even talk about the Sony Playstation

I make it happen if it seems that you won

Aaron Carter got you open

Don't front, don't front

Let's roll

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young, I'm not too old

Here we go...

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young, I'm not too old

He steppin' out with the older boys

Cover up your ears cuz we makin that noise

He steppin' out with the younger girls

Cover up your eyes cuz we rock the world

He steppin' out with the older boys

Cover up your ears cuz we makin that noise

He steppin out with the younger girls

Cover up your eyes cuz we rock the world

See, when it comes to pickin'

All the girls were cruisin'

Am i right?

All I need is pillows. hello, hello.

I'm not too young, my cellular rung

Switch it off, yo

Hit me on the pager

A real teenager, with a fake beard

Batting in the majors

That how we roll

And when it suits me

I'm put my head between my knees

12 years-old

Thats how we roll

Throw your hands up now

Let the music take control

This is how we roll

I'm not too young, I'm not too old

Here we go...  (x3)
