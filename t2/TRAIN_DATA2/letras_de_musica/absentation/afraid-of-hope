Afraid Of Hope
afraid of hope
penetrate to your frowsty cerebellum
and see your lack obsession
what you feel in this moment
what you hear from this voices
subconscious in your eyes
and shock in your mind

you need crutch perhaps your groan scratch

you must live in pain
before you die
to know the truth
in your mind

oblivion hopes,depression disgusting thoughts
misguided lies and mental criticize
