Blind Appetite
blind appetite
every day we live in addiction and vain

twisted body slant to alienation and hide

born with out brain
born addicted to cocaine

the drug that you obtain
it feed your imagine to learn
but you dont know what mean love or hate
only pain the drug create

you live in mystery far away from reality
submerged imagination guilty misfortune

blind appetite
addiction mind (2)
recess denied
better to die
