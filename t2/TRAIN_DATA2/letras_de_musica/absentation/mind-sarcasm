Mind Sarcasm
mind sarcrasm
you missing about this life
and time run out from your days
what is future for you toture and corruption

your mind insecurities like drug in your infected body
look deep in your eyes deceiving masquerade and lies

blind

you still blind

look beyond to the grave maggots feed on your flesh

but in this life moggots feed on your mind
