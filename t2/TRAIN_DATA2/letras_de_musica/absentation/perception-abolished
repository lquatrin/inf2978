Perception Abolished
you defy of earth rules
and expecting eternal glory
quest for virtuous existence
ignorance confined in your psychic mind
distracted,frivolous,deception
looking for faithful salvation
you doubt of your abilities
defectveness in your endocrine

the scream of pain chased our sight
virtually existence over in your mind
ridiculed from creation and hide
so label your thoughts and hold it inside

lies

Karma potential in your self induced
Escaping from reality by excused
Replacing methods by fatal disease
That reflect your curiosity increase

Choke death is your kind fear
Maggots its so near
Late for paying respect
God want your real horrid dead

Your victims will devour your cock
feel the pain, perceive sarcastic death
Your victims will devour your cock
feel the pain, perceive sarcastic death

You must die in fetid grave
And rot from ileum to brain
This is single path to learn
perhaps your mind return

You must die in fetid grave
And rot from ileum to brain
This is single path to learn
perhaps your mind return


Choke death is your kind fear
Maggots its so near
Late for paying respect
God want your real horrid death

life is never fair with your kind
