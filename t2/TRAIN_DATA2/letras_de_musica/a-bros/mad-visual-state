Visions tear my sanity, 
Dragging me into the void. 
Cannot tell what I see, 
Outcast: your reality. 

Mad visual state. 
I'm trapped. 
Mad visual state. 
I'm trapped. 
Mad visual state. 

Fused bars of confusion, 
One with my decaying mind. 
A dreamcage is now complete, 
The world is drenched in deceit. 

We are trapped to be dreaming. 

Linked past other levels, 
I emerge to disappear. 
Out of options, I hide. 
Insubstancial walls collide. 

Mad visual state. 
I'm trapped. 
Mad visual state. 
I'm trapped. 
Mad visual state.
