I have locked the chest, 
to keep them away from you. 
This trust of yours, 
was given to me. 
You were so blind, 
but now you can see. 
Now they know... 

I have failed, 
To keep a secret, 
from their greedy hands. 
I have failed, 
with the quest of my life. 

You thougth I was the one, 
saving you from dispare. 
I couldnt hold on, 
I didn't make it bare. 
You opened your eyes, 
Now you realize. 
Now they know... 

It's to late, 
To make things right. 
It's to late, 
To work it out. 

I have failed! 
I have failed!
