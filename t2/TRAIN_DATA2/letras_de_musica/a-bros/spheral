Reversed in every prospect. 
Denied for all things to come. 
SlippinÂ’ by the trail of conflicts. 
The wish for presence, 
For long gone... 

Create a deception detour. 
Combust emotinal bruise. 
Beyond all hope of recovery. 
The sound of absence, 
Conclusive... 

This smile hurt. 
Undestroyed remains of emotion. 
Reflections hurt. 
Reload this emotional roulette. 
This smile hurt. 
Undestroyed remains of emotion. 
Reflections hurt. 
Reload, 

This ghostly shell. 

Introduce a final chapter. 
Black eyes pierce through. 
Destroys the chance of escape. 
The returning pieces, 
Of nightmares. 

Reversed, Reversed. 
Denied, Denied.
