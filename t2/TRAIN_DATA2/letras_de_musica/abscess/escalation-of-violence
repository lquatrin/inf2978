Eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's time to die

Choking on the stench of death
Sorrow fills every breath
Burning mountains of the dead
With blood runs the river red

Hate breeds hate, escalation of violence

See the flying war machines
Dropping seeds of fire
See the hatred bloom
Rise and burn the world

An eye for an eye, the world goes blind

Ride the wheel of vengeance
Paint the land with blood
On the wave of violence
Rise and burn the world

Hate breeds hate, escalation of violence

Walk among the carnage
Behold the sea of dead
Justice is done
Vengeance has begun

The wheels of war machine howl
As it's picking up seed
Blinded by anger
The wolves of war feed
Religions of hatred passed on
From the father to son
No turning back
The cycle of vengeance has begun
