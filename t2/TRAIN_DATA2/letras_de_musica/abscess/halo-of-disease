Flies Buzzin' in your Pisshole 
Maggot Crawling in Your Eyes 
Thats what I see when I look at you 
As Mind curls up and dies 
Everyones Agaist me 
Everybody Hates me 
Nobody wants to know me 
They all Think I'm crazy 

Lick your Skin off with my tongue 
Barbed Wire Teeth 
Feast has begun 

I Wanna withdrawn and puke 
In the Cornet of the Room 
I Wanna Shit and Bathe in 
Shadows, Stench and Gloom 
I Wanna Choke and Heave 
on Psychotic Solitude 
Black Death on a Stick 
Shit filled veins protrude 

Lick your Skin off with my tongue 
Barbed Wire Teeth 
Feast has begun
