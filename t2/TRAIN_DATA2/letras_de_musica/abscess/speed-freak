I've Got Worms Living in My Skin 
Squeeze them out watch them crawl back in 
I hear Fleas jumping in my Bed 
The Teeth are falling out of my Head 
All I own I Took Apart 
I never finish what I Start 

Speed Freak, Addicted 

Junkie Whore Fuck Tommorrow 
Ten Bucks More She Will Swallow 
Manic Menstrual Crankslut Bitch 
Zits are bigger than her Tits 
Breathe Stinks of her Rotting Stomach 
Triple X Star on her Anal Fist Fuck 

Speed Freak, Addicted 

I Look Out the Window I See Faces Looking In 
Can I Believe I am seeing things can not be 
Time melts whats real who's inside my mind 
Without sleep dream awake open eyes are blind 

Fetus Formed just half a brain 
Little bitty Baby born insane 
Pneumonia in its tiny lungs 
The pain of life has just begun 
Dreams of what life could of been 
But Mom was hooked on Methamphetamine
