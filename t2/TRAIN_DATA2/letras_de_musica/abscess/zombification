Rotted Faces One by One
Shambling Slow but Sure to Dine on
the Living Flesh and Blood
Ripping Out Then Eating Guts
Fresh Corpse on the Ground
Hideous Death Head Twisted Around
Hand Made Incision Chest Torn Wide
Intestines Pulled Out from Inside
Moaning as the Maggots Crawl
through Crusted Faces and Eyeballs
Hunber for the Living Skin
Your Blood runs Cold Your Death Begins to Rise up from the Grave
to Recruit Another Slave
Bound to Hunger Bloody Thrist
with Endless Living Death You're Cursed
