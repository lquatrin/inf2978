My blood is fire 
My mind is black 
Pain burning bright 
Time to explode 
All the sickness inside 
Tortured beyond comprehension 
Rotten wounds abscess and boil 
Stitches about to burst 
And the ground ripped wide, the skies split forth 
The souls broke free as the blood-soaked sea 
Fingertips like the caverns of hell 

Vaginal opening poised to the sky 
Breeding madness and anarchy from the unknown 
Cranium cracking with grey desecration 
Black hallucinogenic trip spurn elation 

And the ground ripped wide, the skies split 
Forth and the rain was bloody and smiling rage 
The souls broke free as the blood-soaked sea 
Fingertips like the caverns of hell 
Vaginal opening poised to the sky 
Breeding madness and anarchy from the unknown 
Cranium cracking with grey desecration 
Black hallucinogenic trip spurn elation 
The tombs of hell deep dark disease 
Torn into hunger and rabid thirst 
Screaming nightmare, minds collide 
Devils cum as angels die 

Doom from the beyond, pain from above 
Death from below, mercy in flames 
Red crucifixion, eyes see but rot 
Volcanic death scenes, hellfire remains 

Thorns thrust in deep 
Horns crimson stained 
Scorched ruined world 
All die in pain
