Breathe your fears deep
Twist the knife darkly
Again and again and again
And again and again
Serpents tongue slithers
The poison flows swift
Await eternal sleep
Foaming at the mouth
Bloody fists an fingers
Tearing at the sky
Taste of doom's breath
Mind turned to rubble
Burn burn burn burn burn

Engorged with filth
Cemetary screams
Heart imploding
Into bloodied dreams

Chorus:
Serpent of dementia
Mental disintegration
Serpent of dementia
Die in morbid elation

Arms outstretched
To oblivion
Final sleep
Under the rotting sun

Chorus

Rape o veins... orgasmic doom
Mind and nervous system blown
Penetration in the tomb
Tail tightly around your throat
