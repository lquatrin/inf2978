Put Me in Charge of Population Control
I'll Make Sure We Have lots of Room
I'll Make Sure No One Gets Out Alive
I'll Make Sure Nothing Here Can Survive
Public Executions Held Daily

I'll Shut Down all the Pharmacies
to Promote the Spread of Disease
A New Virus in the Water Supply
No Food No Shelder Everyone Dies

You Have Been Chosen for Sterilzation
By the Department of Depopulation

Put me in Charge of Population Control
I'll Free all the Prisoners on Death Row
Put them in Charge of Population Control
Police let Blood Flow on Your Shitty City Streets

You have been Chosen for Sterilzation
By the Department of Depopulation
