Implode into darkness 
Leave this world to die 
Voices of deception 
A belt of terror in time 
Images of the sick 
Demented thoughts 
Tweak your sight 
Unable to get your fill 
Veins running dry 

Indulged in mind manipulations 
A tirade of hallucinations 

Tap the black vein 
As it pierces your skull 
Watch maggots fall 
From its hole 
Dripping flesh from bone 
A hell created on my own
