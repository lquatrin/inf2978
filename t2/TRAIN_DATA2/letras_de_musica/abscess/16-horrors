Phantoms living underground
That feed on flesh
Mummified we are engauzed
Who rise to kill
Crawling evil eyes are sent
To bring you death
Your body dessicates
The seed it lives on still

Rising from the dead
Feast upon the live
Lycanthropic fiend
Humans into flies

From the skies to burst
From meteoric tomb
Up from blackest waters
Choke and drag you down
Pieced from limbs abnormal
Bringing fear and doom
Penetrating fangs sink deep
In blood I drown

Open book of skin
Devil children's birth
Bloody chainsaw teeth
Bled for all your worth
