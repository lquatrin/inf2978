Wormwind Has begun it's come to eat your Hollow Soul
Wormwind for our sins and From Our Filth begins to Grow
Wormwind rises high to spread plague far and wide
Wormwind is the pale horse that death rides

Ride the Locust, Lord of the Flies
Burn off Your Face, Swallow your Eyes

God of War, Lord of the Flies
Swallow the Sun, Blacken the Skies

God of War, Lord of the Flies
Swallow the Sun, Blacken the Skies

Wormwind Has begun it's come to eat your Hollow Soul
Wormwind will consume you and return you to the soil
Wormwind locust wings descend deafening blacken skies
Wormwind is the larva and the maggot and the fly
Wormwind sky will fall and crush our city to chalk dust
Wormwind leaves a place of bone and blood and rocks and dust
Wormwind kille the crops and strips the cattle of of its hide
Wormwind rises high to spread plague far and wide

God of War, Lord of the Flies
Swallow the Sun, Blacken the Skies
