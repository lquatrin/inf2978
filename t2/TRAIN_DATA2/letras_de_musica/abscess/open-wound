Bask Under Bloodfall
Head in the Wound
A Doorway Through the Skin
A Taste of the Tomb
Join the Malady
Imploding Veins
Burrowing Deep Within
Tormenting What Was
Your Weakened Brain 

I Want Your Open Wound 

Wavering Senses 
Blue Skin in Flaps
Ravenous Breakdowns
Barbed Wire Straps
Hungering Coffin
Red Eyes Peek
Ravage the once Whole
Bleed Dry the Weak 

I Want Your Open Wound 

I Want Your Open Wound
