Leech Boy 
I Caught a great 
Big batch Today 
Walked Out of the Water 
and Felt them Suck 
Tiny Teeth 
Affixed to my Flesh 
Glisterning Denizens of Muck 

Leech -- I'm a Leech Boy 

My Folks they 
Sent me out again 
There'll Be no Food 
Without you Boy 
That's fine cause 
They're my little Friends 
My Family My Food 
My Toys 

Leech -- I'm a Leech Boy
