The shadow of death is always near 
I see it clear, there is comfort there 
Death is life as life is death 
Sufferance eternal, sufferance immortal 
The well has run dry, the crops have died 
Empty, hollow, today and tomorrow 
No hope for a better life 
Don't dare to dream 
The dream is dead 

No hope, the dream is dead 
No future, the dream is dead 

No hope, no future 
The shadow of death is following 
It wakes me, it speaks to me 
It says it has much work to do 
It's coming for me, it's coming for you 
The rains have stopped, the cattle have died 
Then comes the frost, the all is lost 
When the working poor can't work no more 
Don't dare to dream 
The dream is dead
