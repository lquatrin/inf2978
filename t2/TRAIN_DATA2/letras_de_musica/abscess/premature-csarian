His morbid act was done lonely 
He knew that the bastard son wasn't his 
So he turned his wife to shredded meat 
She screamed and pissed in pain 

He laughed when slashed her eyes 
Mangled her members with a saw 
Her mouth foaming, having convulsions 
Opened her belly with bare hands 

Slashed the woman searching her womb 
And ate her innards holding the embryo 
It was insanely erased with a sandpaper 
Then he nailed it upon the fire place 

As a reward for his bloody hunt 
He buried its corpse in the garden 
He learned to live with this 
Because now his obscure past 
Lies six feet down the ground
