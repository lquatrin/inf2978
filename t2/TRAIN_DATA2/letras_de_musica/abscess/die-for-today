Beautiful you are
Although your thirst it does consume
Ride the drean a greased up queen
Sinking towards the tomb
What was once a taste
Has now become your own desire
Wearing out your flesh
Your habit lives while you expire

Chorus:
Knees scabbed up
Eyeliner running black
Fragile little spiders legs
Pupils blown out
Blown out to the sky
Mushroomed needs
It's all too late

Panic eye the tide runs low
Your nose and arms they crave
Time for fuel and sanctuary
Fodder for the grave
Pretty face, a shattered smile
A broken fate within
Blue screen baby time's gone out
Push the needle in

Chorus

Eye of the camera zooms in on you
Capturing moments you wish weren't true
Paid in white, junked up and back on your route
A vision too bright, must always fade out
