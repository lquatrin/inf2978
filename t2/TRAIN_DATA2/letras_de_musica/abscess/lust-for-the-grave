All I see is black and torturous 
Darkness take me 
Brain is rotten, sewage in my blood 
Darkness free me 
Alcohol and drugs, obscurity 
Call the reaper 
Only in the coffin I'll be free 
Death my keeper 
Moving toward the unlight, fate is sealed 
Doom is waiting 
Total darkness soon to be revealed 
Fill the casket 
To the graveyard, never coming back 
Feed the maggots 

Make me lust for death 
Show me the world 
And I'll take my last breath 
Make me lust for death 
Take me to the end 
It's all tha's left
