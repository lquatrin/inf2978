Toothpicks in my Eyeballs
Razors in My Ass
Female Pig against my Cheeks
Sucking up my Gas
Swilling From the Gutter
As Others Watch and Beg
Pleading to be me for Once
Pissing on my Leg

They Claw at my Soul
With a Jagged Knife
And Suck at my Blood
With a Withered Life
Guts on Fire and 
Bowels Wrecked
Blasted Mind Black
Graveyard Bet

Vomiting on Faces
Which Vomit Back in Turn
Stabbing Holes in Sanity
Watching Reason Burn
None with Understanding
None Could dare to be
Black Veined Teeth
Within the Lock 
Let My Bones be Free
