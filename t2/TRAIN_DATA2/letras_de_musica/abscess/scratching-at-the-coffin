Crawling out from Under
Come back to Go Again
Digging Out from Under 
To Kill Again

Splinter Pierced Broken Fingers
Bone Rips Through the Skin
Breaking off at each Knuckle
Scratching at the Coffin

You Organized the Lynching
You Watch the Corpse Swing in the Wind
But What you thought was Over
Was About to Begin

Splinter Pierced Broken Fingers
Bone Rips Through the Skin
Breaking off at each Knuckle
Scratching at the Coffin

I'm Digging out from Under
I'm Coming after You
In Death I Still Remember
The Live you Put me Through
Crawling Up From Hell
You're Coming Back with Me
Screams of Death and Vengeance
Hate Sets me Free
