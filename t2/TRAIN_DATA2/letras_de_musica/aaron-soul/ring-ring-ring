One to one
Ericson, battery done

My, baby iÂ’m sorry when we were last face to face,
There was some tension up in the place,
Girl i didnÂ’t mean to flip, trying to hold it down and get a grip,
Temperature was rising up on our case,

As i left the scene i said some things i didnÂ’t mean
I had some beef to release instead of holding down the peace,
As i got home i thought of it once or twice,
Some things i said baby just werenÂ’t nice,

Whenever i call you now it seems like your not home,
Are you with somebody else or are you alone?

Why donÂ’t you call me like i wish you would?
Like i think you should, that why iÂ’m sitting here listening,

Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
I really want you to call me, why donÂ’t you call me like i wish you would?
Ring, ring, ring, your telephone keep ringing,
Why donÂ’t you answer your phone right, when iÂ’m ring to see if youÂ’re feeling fine?
Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
Now you got me worrying now you got me panicking,
Ring, ring, ring, your telephone keep ringing,
Girl you got me thinking 'bout the things iÂ’ve been saying,

My, baby i promise when we are next face to face
IÂ’ll pay attention to your style & your grace,
You know iÂ’ll keep it tight,
IÂ’ll be right there right by your side,
Anything you want girl, everything to your taste,

I know as i left the scene i said some things i didnÂ’t mean
I had some beef to release, instead of holding down the peace,
Now iÂ’m singing this song to this melody,
Hoping my phone sings this ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,

Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
I really want you to call me why donÂ’t you call me like i wish you would?
Ring, ring, ring, your telephone keep ringing,
Why donÂ’t you answer your phone right, when iÂ’m ring to see if youÂ’re feeling fine?
Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
Now you got me wondering now you got me panicking,
Ring, ring, ring your telephone keep ringing,
Girl you got me thinking 'bout the things iÂ’ve been saying,

SheÂ’s watching her caller i.d
And sheÂ’s watching to see if itÂ’s me who is calling,
She wonÂ’t ring me to tell me weÂ’re cool
And iÂ’m sitting here waiting for her like a fool,
Someone should tell her she should watch her back
Â‘cause i might find another to scratch my back,
But in the meantime i am still waiting for my phone to start singing
And ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,

Ring, ring, ring, [ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring]
My telephones not ringing,
I really want you to call me why donÂ’t you call me like i wish you would?
Ring, ring, ring, your telephone keep ringing,
Why donÂ’t you answer your phone right, when iÂ’m ring to see if youÂ’re feeling fine?
Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
Now you got me worrying now you got me panicking,
Ring, ring, ring your telephone keep ringing,
Girl you got me thinking 'bout the things iÂ’ve been saying,

Ring, ring, ring, [ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring]
My telephones not ringing,
I really want you to call me why donÂ’t you call me like i wish you would?
Ring, ring, ring, your telephone keep ringing,
Why donÂ’t you answer your phone right, when iÂ’m ring to see if youÂ’re feeling fine?
Ring, ring, ring, my telephones not ringing,
Now you got me worrying now you got me panicking,
Ring, ring, ring your telephone keep ringing,
Girl you got me thinking 'bout the things iÂ’ve been saying.
