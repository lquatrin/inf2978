Who's got what it takes be my guy,
What it take's to make me shine,
What it take's to get me fired up.

Who's got what it takes be my beau,
What it take's to make me glow,
What it take's to make this beat flow.

Everyone talk's about what they think they need,
they are making a list of things : 1,2,3
Everyone is different but we can agree,
every girl wants her boy to treat her sweat.

Don't think that bein mean will get you anywhere,
Don't think that acting cool will make me wanna care,
I need your respect and you're gonna be the one,
And if you must get five then try to get the job done.

Who's got what it takes be my guy,
What it take's to make me shine,
What it take's to get me fired up.

Who's got what it takes be my beau,
What it take's to make me glow,
What it take's to make this beat flow.

I've been conteplating,
What it takes to make me give my heart,
Could you be the one,
Standing in the crowd I'm waiting to find out,
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, OH.

Who's got what it takes be my guy,
What it take's to make me shine,
What it take's to get me fired up.

Who's got what it takes be my beau,
What it take's to make me glow,
What it take's to make this beat flow.
