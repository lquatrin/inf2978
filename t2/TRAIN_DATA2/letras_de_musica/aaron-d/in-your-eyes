Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go,
I come back to the place you are

And all my instincts, they return
And the grand facade, so soon will burn
Without a noise and without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light, the heat
I am complete
I see the doorway to a thousand churches
The resolution to all my fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light as you heat
Yes, I wanna be that complete
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and these moments keep slipping away
I get so tired, working so hard for my survival
I look to the time with you, to keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts, they return
And the grand facade, so soon will burn
Without a noise and without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light, the heat
I am complete
I see the doorway to a thousand churches
The resolution to all my fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light as you heat
Oh, I wanna be that complete
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
