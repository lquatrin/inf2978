Magnified Face Help the Bitch See Clearly

Boss of the Ghetto With the Round Shape Cookie 
Shit One, Dro One Nigga Flood the Block 
If I Don't Go to Jail Niggas Birds Gone Flop 
Nigga Sittin' On the Toilet Bitch Get Off the Pot 
The Bird Just Landed So the Hood Gon' Rot 
New Whips, Big Chips the Prada Gucci Shit 
But Mami Your Fly Benz the Wide Skinny Lips 
She Takes My Flight She Holds My Weight 
While the Po-po Staked Out From State to State

Pay the Cars, Big Money, Heavy Weight, Bird Man, Hood Boss 
Baby Steppin On My Line I'll Show a Little Somethin' 
They Callin' You Don't Come Out Then the Black Crow Will Touch Ya (Touch Ya)

[chorus (2x)]

[pusha T] 
Ughhh...another Soul Lost 
Had to Make a Shirt Match My Ox Blood Colored Porsche 
Ughhh...the Rims Match of Course 
Blood Hit His Timbs It Reminded Me of Them 
Glistenin' Wrist On Chiller 
Gun in the Same Palm of Gorgeous Killer 
I Put This On My Lord My Niece Was 4 When She Felt Chinchilla 
I Past the Shore For That Shit That Made Fiends Rise From the Dead Like 
Thriller 
Gangster...hustler 
At Night Still Found Time to Kiss My Mother 
Live Like I'm Dreamin' Kick My Feet Up 
Gun Pulled My Waist Remind Me of My Demon 
So Quite Ya Yappin' Fore I Get to Clappin 
And Have Your Body Parts Mix and Matching Fella
