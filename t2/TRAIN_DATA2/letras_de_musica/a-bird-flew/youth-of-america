Say a Prayer For the Youth of America 
God Bless the Youth of America 

I Can't Stand This Anymore 
All the Dead Kids Lying On the Door 
And You Don't Hear a Word They're Telling You 

You're All Dead X2 

You've Been Wasted 

Don't Believe a Thing They're Selling You 
Gotta Carrot On the Stick in Front of You 
Taking Back From the Halocaust 
You Know We Can't Even Use It Now 
It Was Yours 
In the First Place Anyway 

You're All Dead X2 

Been Wasted 

You're All Dead X2 

Wasted! 

Say a Prayer For the Youth of America... (X4)
