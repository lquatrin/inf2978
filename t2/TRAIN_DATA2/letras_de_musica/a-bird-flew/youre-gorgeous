(Y. O. U. R. E. G. O. R. G. E. O. U. S.)

Remember That Tanktop You Bought Me
You Wrote "You're Gorgeous" On It
You Took Me to Your Rented Motor Car
And Filmed Me On the Bonnet
You Got Me to Hitch My Knees Up
And Pulled My Legs Apart
You Took An Instamatic Camera
And Pulled My Sleeves Around My Heart

(Chorus:)
Because You're Gorgeous
I'd Do Anything For You
Because You're Gorgeous
I Know You'll Get Me Through

You Said My Clothes Were Sexy
You Tore Away My Shirt
You Rubbed An Icecube On My Chest
Snapped Me Till It Hurt

(Chorus)

You Said I Wasn't Cheap
You Paid Me 20 Pounds
You Promised to Put Me in a Magazine
On Every Table in Every Lounge

(Chorus)

Because You're Gorgeous
I'd Do Anything For You
Because You're Gorgeous
I Know You'll Get Me, Know You'll Get Me Through
Know You'll Get Me Through
Know You'll Get Me Through
Know You'll Get Me, Know You'll Get Me Through
I Know You'll Get Me, Know You'll Get Me
Know You'll Get Me Through

(Chorus)

Because You're Gorgeous
I'd Do Anything For You
Because You're Gorgeous
I Know You'll Get Me, Know You'll Get Me Through
Know You'll Get Me Through
