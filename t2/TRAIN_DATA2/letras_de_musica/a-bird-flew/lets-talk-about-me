Oh God Here She Comes 
With Her Big Mouth Firing Like a Verbal Machine Gun
Cant Tell How You Fit All the Words in There
You Talk Talk Talk
Til I Cant Understand a Single Word Your Sayin
Dont You Ever Want to 
Give Those Lips a Rest

My Friends
My Clothes
My Hair
Dont You Know I Dont Care
Lets Talk About Me
Dont Want to Hear About You Anyway
Nobodys Listenin to a Word You Say
Lets Talk About Me Now

I Know How You Think 
That the Stuff That
Happens to You Really Matters
I Sure You Think Were All Intrigued
But If You Stood in My Shoes
Youd Know Its Really Just a Drag to See You
And Thats When Big Mouth Strikes Again

My Place
My Face 
My Stare
Dont You Know I Dont Care
Lets Talk About Me
Dont Wanna Hear About You Anyway
Nobodys Listenin to a Word You Say
Lets Talk About Me Now
Might Tell Me X's 4

Oh Girl Youre So Sad
Did I Go and Say Something That Made You Feel Bad?
No Really I Am Listening
So Go On Chill That Nasal Voice 
Right Through the Middle of My Head
Im Lasting 
Wishing You Were Dead

My Friends
My Clothes
My Hair 
Dont You Know I Dont Care
Lets Talk About Me
Dont Wanna Hear About You Anyway
Nobody's Listenin to a Word You Say
Lets Talk About Me
Now
Lets Talk About Me
Dont Wanna Listen to You Anyway 
Nobody's Listenin to a Word You Say
Lets Tak About Me Now
Lets Tak About Me 
Gonna Talk About Me Now
