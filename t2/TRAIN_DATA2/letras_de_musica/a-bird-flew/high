She Was Trying to Hide Away 
Hoping Nobody Will Find Her There 
People Making So Much Noise 
There Was Nothing Left to Hurry Now 
Oh Well 

Found Her Floating in Her Room 
All the Colors That Surrounded Her 
Tell Me How I Complain 
When She Looked So Peaceful in the Air 
I Left Her There 

She Was High 
Everything's Fine in Her Mind 
She Can Leave Behind All the Anger and Just Fly 
Nothing But Time 
No One Unkind 
Bringing Unhappiness Into Her Happy World 

We Would Talk For Hours On End 
She Was Magical Inside Her Head 
Visions no One Else Believed 
They Were Meant 
For Only Her and Me 
Now I Can See 

She Was High... 

And Now I Believe Her 
And I Won't Disturb the Silence of Her World 

It Was Sad to See Her Go 
There Will Never Be Another One 
Neas As Wonderful As Her 
Though I'm Glad to See She 's Finally Won 
It's All Been Done 

She Was High..
