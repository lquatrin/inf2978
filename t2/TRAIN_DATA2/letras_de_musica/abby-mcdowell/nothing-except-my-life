Floral dresses hangin' on my wall
Next to my bathrobe.
I wish I could wear the short, yeah.
It would be really neat,
But my butt is too big...
I'll settle for the long one.
Have to wear the long one.
Saw these shoes at Pic 'n' Pay or Payless.
I never could tell the two stores a part.
Well, these shoes were neat, but they
Wouldn't fit my feet.
'Cause my size is a ten...
I'll buy a bigger pair.
'Cause my feet are big.
Golden scrunchie sitting in my drawer.
I can put my hair in it.
But I wouldn't dare wear it 'cause it went
Out in ninety-two.
But I'm hoping it may...
Come on back in style.
'Cause I have hair now.
