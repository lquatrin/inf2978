Was it rage or regret
Or the love I was feeling
In this age - whos perfect... are you? 

Wasn't made to forget
This moment worth stealing
Was it rage or regret or the two

Every morning when I wake up
Wake up dreaming then... wake up dreaming
Build a temple from your fragrance
Build a chapel in your heart

Do you really understand
Do you feel the need to try
Do you even care for me
Do you ever wonder why

Rage and then regret
bout as real as real can get
Rage and then regret

Through the violence the angry silence
Does our love, grow strong or die
A parachute or a pilots license
Do we fall in love or fly

Do you really understand
Do you feel the need to cry
Do you even care bout me
Do you ever wonder why

Rage and then regret
bout as real as real can get
Rage and then regret

The harder we come
The harder we fall
The harder it is to stand tall
The more that we fight
The more that we brawl
The more were alike - thats all... thats all

Rage and then regret
bout as real as real can get
Rage and then regret
Rage and then regret
bout as real as real can get
There are things you don't forget
Anger cools to idle threats
