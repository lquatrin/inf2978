Rich and wealthy canvas
Clustered up in jewels
Finding all your heavyweights
Are featherweights and fools

Broken all your promises
Broken all your paper plates
Clustered in gold
Crusted in gold

Heavy and hollow
Look at the shape were in
Find us here
Paper thin
Heavy and humble
Look at the shape were in
Find us here
Paper thin

In origami cities
In nations build on sand
Love got bend right outta shape
Things got outta hand

Polystyrene skylines
Papier mch smiles
Rusted and bruised
Tarnished and frail

Heavy and hollow
Look at the shape were in
Find us here
Paper thin
Heavy and humble
Look at the shape were in
Find us here
Paper thin

Stars scrape the moon
And the moon scrapes the sky
We stand beneath
Wondering why

Stars scrape the moon
And the moon scrapes the sky
We stand beneath
Wondering, wondering why

Paper buys the men
The men that make the bomb
The bomb that makes this world
Paper thin!

Money markets crumble
Gentle as a drum
But if you see me stumble, im
Paper thin!

Life is but a fragile thing
So delicate and pure
An accolade bestowed on us
Paper thin!

So contemplate the skull
The skull beneath the skin
One day we all die, were
Paper thin

Bury your destruction
In your last battle hymn
The barriers between us, make em all
Paper thin! paper thin!
Paper thin! paper thin!
Underneath the paper moon
The sky is paper thin
Torn into a thousand shreds
So let the solar system in

Rich and wealthy canvas
Clustered up in jewels
Finding all your heavyweights
Are featherweights and fools

In origami cities
In nations build on sand
Love got bend right outta shape
Nothing ends as planned

And its all-paper thin
Paper thin. 
Paper thin
