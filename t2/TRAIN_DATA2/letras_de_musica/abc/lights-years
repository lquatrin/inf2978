Sitting watching stars exploding
Building blocks that make
This world go round
On some distant planet cluster
Future gazing, no sight or sound
Sitting godlike mother nature
Now immortal, on my own
Light years from home

Light years from home
Light years from home

Crimson shades of evening glimmer
Across the counts of earth below
Shield your love like buried treasure
And all the secrets that you hold
Let them go

And as the daylight
Brings the morning
I reach out for you
Anaesthetic for the heartache
Now I'll never feel alone
Light years from home

Light years from home
Light years from home
Sitting watching stars exploding
