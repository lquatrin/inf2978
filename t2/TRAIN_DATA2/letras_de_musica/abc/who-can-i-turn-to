If only i could stand
On my own two feet
Oh honey, then i'd know
Life could be so sweet

Someone to drive
Someone to blame
Someone to rush through my veins
Someone to wash it all away

* who can i turn to now
If not you, tell me
Who can i turn to
If not you

If i could get
What i want for free
Then i wouldn't have to borrow
Take a tranquilliser
From your limousine driver
Before we crash into tomorrow

Someone to love
Someone to hold me
Someone so courageous
Someone to drag me in from the cold

(* repeat 3 times)

Who can i turn to (tell me who)
Who's gonna be there (if not you)
Tell me who (tell me)
Tell me who (tell me)
Tell me who
Tell me who can i turn to
(if not you)
Ooh (tell me who)
You've got to, you've got to
Tell me who
