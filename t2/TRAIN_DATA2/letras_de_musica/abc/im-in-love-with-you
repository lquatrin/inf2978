I-I would swim the seven seas

I-I would crawl upon my knees

I-I Climb mountains high for you

I-I would guarantee your every dream come true

...come true



Oh I-I'm in love with you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I wouldn't cheat on you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

With you...



I-I would drink an ocean dry

I-I Would pluck the moon out from the sky

I-I would build a palace just for you

I-I could give you...Park Avenue

...Park Avenue



Oh I-I'm in love with you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I wouldn't cheat on you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

With you...



I-I could travel back in time

I-I would kill a man to make you mine

I-I would leap the Empire State

I-I'd win a war, just to conquer hate

...conquer hate



Oh I-I'm in love with you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I wouldn't cheat on you

Yes it's true

Oh I-I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

With you...
