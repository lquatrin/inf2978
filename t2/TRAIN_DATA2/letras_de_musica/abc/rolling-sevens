I was tired of Lady Luck taking me for what she could get
Smoking me down like her last cigarette
See, luck's a dime in dozen in a thousand different places
Every country cousin's holding five sweet aces
All of a sudden love shines down on me

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way

Poets and philosophers can say what they like
But they've never been to your place
After the clock strikes midnight
Zooming in on you brought me into focus
All the wild cards start turning into jokers
All of a sudden, love rains down on me

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way

Kissing you is like the angels kissing heaven
When I roll those dice, I swear I'm rolling sevens
I'll do whatever you want, whatever you say
Everything's going our way
(Oh yeah, going our way)
(Rolling sevens, rolling sevens)
Everything's going our way
