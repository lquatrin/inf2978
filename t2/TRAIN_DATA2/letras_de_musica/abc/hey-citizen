Here they come,
Slumming their way outta the jacuzzi,
We'll, I've lived in a slum, sugar plum,
Hit and run
And it did not amuse me
There they go,
Moving around on the radio,
We'll I've been on that show,
Reap and sow, feed and grow
And it did not amuse me

Hey citizen! hey american!
Hey russian! hey citizen!

Beauty stab,
When the good things in life
Have all grown bad,
The cats out the bag
Smash and grab, burn the flag
And didnt it fool me throw it out,
It's not worth the paper it's written on
No ifs and buts,
Spending cuts, cheaper smut,
They say they could use me

All through summer,
Theres no glamour in the slammer,
No glamour in the slammer,
Until you make a run
All through summer, the splendours
Pretty slender
The splendours pretty slender
Until you make a run

Here they come,
Slumming their way out of the jacuzzi,
We'll I've lived in a slum, sugar plum,
Hit and run and it did not amuse me
There they go,
Grooving around on the radio
We'll I've been on that show, reap and sow
Feed and grow, and it didn't amuse me

Hey villager! hey citizen!
Hey countryman! hey, now listen!
Hey chinaman! hey european!
Hey russian! hey american!
Hey cowboy! hey indian!
Hey anyway! hey, hey, hey citizen!
