Every problem has solutions

Look inside your heart, see what you might find

You can draw your own conclusions

There's summer in your soul, winter in your mind



I love, I love, I love you

I need, I need, I need you there

I love, I love, I love you

Let me be your answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Don't cry, tears dry

Answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)



Unhappy for a long time

A subtle shade of blue, indigo, that's you

You say that love's so hard to find

It just eluded you, I've been eluded, too



I love, I love, I love, I love you

I need, I need, I need you there

I've got to, got to, got to have you

Let me be your answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Don't cry, tears dry

Answered prayer

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Don't cry, tears dry

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)



Open up your mind, open up your heart

Unlock your dreams, unchain desire

Open up your arms, open up your eyes

Answer my prayer



Truth be told, word to the wise

Open your heart, babe, open your eyes

Unlock your dreams, unchain desire

Answer my prayer, answer my prayer



Answer my prayer

Prayer



(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

All I want you to do, all I want to do

Is to answer my prayer, answer baby

(Answer my, answer my, answer my prayer)

Don't cry

Now give me answer, give me an answer, give me an answer

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
