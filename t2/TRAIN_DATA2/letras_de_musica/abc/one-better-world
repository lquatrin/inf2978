Politician preaching - on TV
Saying nothing but - vote for me
Everybody, everywhere
We got a love, got a love
Got a love we gotta share

One better world
One better world
One better world

Papers feeding - lies each day
Are you believing - what they say?
Pulpit preachers - selling God
Making big bucks - is that enough?

Everybody, everywhere
We got a love, got a love
Got a love we gotta share

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere
Let the lion lie down with the lamb
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere
Don't use the color of the skin to judge a man

Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere
Does it matter if you're gay or if you're straight?
Someway - Somehow - Some place - Somewhere
If it does you fill this world with hate

Underneath a flag
Love is just a name
But underneath the moon
We are all the same
