Knifing My Way Through a Diamond Mine
Dragging Those Rocks
From Seabed to Shoreline
Rubies and Sapphires From Emerald Bay
Stretching Across the Milky Way
One Day... One Day...

Prospecting Gold and Staking My Claim
But the Only Thing I Treasure
Is Hearing Your Name
Most Everyone Dreams Diamonds and Furs
I Dream of Love and Baby It's Yours
One Day... One Day...

One Day You'll Realise
You'll See It On Her Eyes
No Room For Alibis - One Day... One Day...
One Day You'll Realise
Feel Me Materialise
You'll See You're Just a Fool to Leave Me
One Day... One Day... One Day Soon Baby

They Say That Your Life Is An Open Book
Well I Just Wrote a Chapter So Take a Look
Can't Blame It On Fate Or Destiny
Now That Your Book... It Features Me
One Day... One Day...

One Day You'll Realise
You'll See It On Her Eyes
No Room For Alibis - One Day... One Day...
One Day You'll Realise
Feel Me Materialise
You'll See You're Just a Fool to Leave Me
One Day... One Day... One Day Soon Baby

Hardly a Day Goes By Without Me Thinking of You
No Matter How Hard I Try You Can't Escape a Dream
Living My Life - in the Lap of Luxury
Living My Life - Confuse Me... Confuse Me Babee

One Day You'll Realise
You'll See It On Her Eyes
No Room For Compromise - One Day... One Day...
One Day You'll Realise
Feel Me Materialise
You'll See You're Just a Fool to Leave Me

You Can't Shake a Dream - How I Wish That You Could
One Day You're Mine Get That Understood
Until Then Each Night I Shall Pray
For a Love That Lasts Forever And...
One Day... One Day...
