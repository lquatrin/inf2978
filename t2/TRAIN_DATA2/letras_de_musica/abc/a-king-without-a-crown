Welcome to the great republic
Guess I should show you round
Where once I was a King
And now I am a clown

The love that we once shared
Made a King of me
But now you're gone...but now you're gone
All I face is poverty

...King without a heart
...King without a hope
...King without a woman baby
Oh I'm a King without a crown
...King without a heart ...
...King without a hope
...King without a woman baby
Oh I'm a King without a crown

Hell hath no fury
Like a woman scorned
But heaven don't boast - no heaven don't boast
The jewel - the pretty jewel I just pawned

Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
Oh but I guess the sun stopped shining
On the day you went away

Bathed in former glory
Deposed from my throne
How do I get to tell my story?
When all get's your answerphone...
But you ain't home

With the love you gave
I felt like royalty
But now you're face to face - face to face
With one ex-member of the aristocracy

There's no need to feel down
Yeah just take a look around
You'll see a man who's just a man
Nothing more
A King without a crown
