Better call and collect
Treat me with respect
If you think our love is pedigree

Push a button... disconnect
Dial again... redirect
You're wrong... you know it isnt me

Totally misguided
Babe youre misadvised
Don't even try to fight it
You're promises are lies

Did you think our love was sacred
Well its much too over-rated
Think again... youre wrong
And our loves a precious memory
Better look what heaven sent me
Think again youre wrong

Don't need a horoscope
Don't need a telescope
To see the way you cheat on me

Think I'd give up hope
Hanging by a rope
If I thought you'd never set me free

Totally misguided

Think our love is strong
Think I'd get excited? 
I think you'd got it wrong

Did you think our love was sacred
Well its much too over-rated
Think again... you're wrong
And our loves a precious memory
Better look what heaven sent me
Think again you're wrong

I'll admit to being confused
And I'm used to being used
Think again... youre wrong
So wrong... so wrong... so wrong
Think again... think again... think!

Think again...think!
Think again... think!

Love to believe you - love you and leave
You're wrong... so wrong
Hate to deceive you - love you then leave
You're wrong... so wrong
No secret sneak preview - don't need to see
You're wrong... so so wrong
