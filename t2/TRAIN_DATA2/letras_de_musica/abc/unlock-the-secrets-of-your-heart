Do you remember sunday nights, summer time at Shoom

Joy big enough to fill the world, just inside that room

Do you remember Friday nights at the Hacienda?

Armistace for gangs, no fights, just beats to make the world surrender



Was it all a dream?

Was it some nightmare?

Crazy as it seems

Love was in the air

No war, no hate, no more

If you'd unlock the secrets of your

No war, no hate, no more

If you'd unlock the secrets of your heart



Day to day existence got its gentle grip on you

Suffocating your soul, eclipsing everything you do



(chorus)



Everybody just looking for an answer

Everybody till the day they die

Everybody live with indecision

Everybody seek, everybody find

Everybody want to dance till sunrise

Everybody want to sweat some noise

Everybody want to kiss that DJ

Every single girl, everysingle boy

Everybody got their own sweet wisdom

Everybody just a look to start

Everybody got it, inside their heart



(chorus)



No war, no hate, no more
