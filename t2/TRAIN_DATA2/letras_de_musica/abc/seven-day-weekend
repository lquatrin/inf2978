See the girl in the cabriolet
I'm gonna make her mine someday
The traffic stops and she steps out
Every man starts to scream and shout
Theres a space in the week
It's a date I can keep, oh yeah

Seven day, seven day, seven day
It's a seven day weekend
Seven day, seven day, seven day
It's a seven day weekend

See the girl in the pale peach dress
She's got a body build to caress
Like a one-eyed cat
Outside a seafood store
She's got me begging
More, more, more
I've been saving and saving
And saving my money
To spend it on her

Seven day, seven day, seven day
It's a seven day weekend
Seven day (seven day)
Seven day (seven day) seven day
It's a seven day weekend
Seven day (seven day)
Seven day (seven day) seven day
It's a seven day weekend

Seven day, seven day, seven day

Seven day (saturday)
Seven day (every day) seven day
It's a seven day weekend
Seven day (seven day)
Seven day (seven day) seven day
It's a seven day weekend
Seven day (seven day)
Seven day (seven day) seven day
It's a seven day weekend
