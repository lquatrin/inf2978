Not what you are,
But what you've earned
Where jack-queen-king
Moneys concerned
A friend in need is a friend in debt
That kinda friend king money can forget.
May those that are full get struck dumb
When they tell the hungry of the good times
To come,
More money than sense in their defence
And cheaper jokes at our expense

So if your king is money
Then I feel sorry for you
And if you think that it's funny
Then maybe you do...
Maybe you do king money
King money, king money

The midas touch doesn't mean
That much until you're crippled with greed,
Using gold as a crutch or half a man
For half a crown for half a kingdom
For half a town
No geldt-in-my-pelt-jack,
No cash in my shack so tell me the things
That you think I lack
Just what kinda price are you willing to pay
For a holiday from the royal tourniquet

So if your king is money
Then I feel sorry for you
And if you think that its funny
Then maybe you do...
Maybe you do king money
King money, king money

Standing by the xerox machine
I want to duplicate some money
Build a fortune up in black and white
But I'll need a master copy.

Youre gonna give your love to me
Shake an apple off the apple tree
When she moves its poetry
Come to me now, one, two, three

King ka
King ka
King king money

Plan the perfect double murder
Maybe win the pools when I get some money
Honey, I'll be knee high in consumer
Durables

Adorables...
