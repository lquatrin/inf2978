Hold a candle to a naked flame 
Ask the atheist his Christian name 
Try parachuting from a burning plane 
Finding someone else you could blame 

If I ever thought you'd be lonely
If I ever thought you'd be there 
If I ever fought the alimony 
Painted pony 
You'd be there 

Eskimo heart 
Bedouin throat 
A butcher trussed up in a camel hair coat 
A crowning in the castle 
A drowning in the moat 
Ocean dried 
Desert afloat 

If I ever thought you'd be lonely 
If I ever thought you'd be there 
If I ever fought the alimony 
My one and only 
You'd be there 

One for the lady 
One for the gent 
Signatures in wet cement 
And if you ever ask 
What I meant then I'd never know 
Then I'd never know...
