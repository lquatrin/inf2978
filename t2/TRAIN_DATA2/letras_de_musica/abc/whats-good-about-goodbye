Goodbye!

Every face in the street, everyone that I meet
I think its you in disguise
I hear sweet angels sing, lifes a radiant thing
I'm bewitched and tantalized, yeah

What's good about goodbye? 
No one ever told me
What's good about goodbye? 
Wish you could hold me
Nothing fair about fairwell
Nothing fair at all
What's good about goodbye? 
Nothing at all

I'd be fooling myself, chasing anyone else
It's you that I prize
Why praise to heaven above, why praising God for sweet love? 
When it's you I idolize

(chorus)

What's good, what's good
What's good about goodbye? 
What's good, what's good
I feel bad about good goodbye

No truth in the rumour that parting is sweet
You lose your sense of humour, you feel incomplete
Theres heaven in hello, he'll in goodbye
Now that you're leaving, Id rather die

(chorus)

Goodbye...
