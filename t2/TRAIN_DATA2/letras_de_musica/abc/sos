So here we are

Drifting on an open sea

So here we are

For all we know but then again

We know for all we know

You know, you know



With all the power that I possess

Let's match their money with our own finesse

Why should we ever have to settle for less?

Why does this message always have to be...

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

One cool million for one cool caress



So here we are

Still drifting on an open sea

So here we are

For all we know but then again

We know for all we know

I know, I know



With all the power that I possess

Let's match their money with our own finesse

Why should we ever have to settle for less?

Why does this message always have to be...

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

One cool million for one so possessed



S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.

S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.
