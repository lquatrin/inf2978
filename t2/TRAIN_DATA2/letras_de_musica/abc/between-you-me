So trouble comes strolling through the door
But anything worth havings worth fighting for
Fiction or fact you'll supply the plot
Well both be featured - like it or not

Yes I guess you think I'm stupid and brutal
I should confess that the feeling is mutual

It's not between the devil and the deep blue see
Not between the truth and hypocrisy
Not between freedom and democracy...
But between you - between you...
Between you and me
Between you - between you...
Between you and me

The stars and stripes meet the hammer and sickle
Not for honour but roubles and nickles
It aint fisticuffs, it's a full scale war
Your secrets no secret anymore

Yes I guess you think I'm stupid and brutal
I should confess that the feeling is mutual

It's not between the devil and the deep blue see
Not between the truth and hypocrisy
Not between freedom and democracy...
But between you - between you...
Between you and me
Between you - between you...
Between you and me

So trouble comes strolling through the door...
