blondes and beach boys
Might marvel at the size
But honey something that big
You now the best don't advertise

Has no-one ever told you
You gotta body build to last?
But with that 15 storey deadstop
You're going nowhere, and fast

10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo!
10-20-30-40! 15 storeys high!
10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo
10-20-30-40? 7 miles wide
7 miles wide!

"Ask a judge and jury
Joe find me 12 just men
We're gonna bottle up their fury
Make sure don't happen again"

All the rebel boys got payrolled
Now they're queuing outside the bank
Like 14 carat playboys
On a trans-cool trans-world tramp

10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo!
10-20-30-40! 15 storeys high!
10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo
10-20-30-40? 7 miles wide
7 miles wide!

And so you meet this guy
A regular gala-had
A real house-trained barbarian
And so you drop him 
Like a bad habit
But anything that comes along
You grab it

Oh we're all waiting
For a saving grace
Hands that soothe
Hands that smoothe the human race
Yes we're all waiting
For a saving grace
Hands that soothe
Hands that smoothe the human race
