I have tried
To make it on my own
And I have survived
But surviving is no rival
For your love

Now I know that it's true
There is no way I cant be
Without you
Heaven knows that it's true
I can't live in this world
Without you

Time you'll find
Can change your mind
My eyes once could see
Only want now to believe
And thought weve tried
I think we'd better face it
A love like ours
You know you can't replace it

Now I know that it's true

Without you

Now I know that it's true

I wonder if there's one chance
It could be
You can't live in this world
Without me
Without me
