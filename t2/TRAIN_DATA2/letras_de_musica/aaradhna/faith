I can feel it
I can feel myself moving
closer to a dream thats waiting for me
I know that ill come across a bumpy path but Ill get through it x2
I can fly high
and i can swim right under the ocean
anythings mine
If i have faith i kno i can do it
I will get by
If i work towards all my dreams
Suns gonna shine
if i have faith i know i can make it
Lifes not ment to be safe
Aint no hard work goes unrewarded im sure
I am willin, i am able im ready
For watever that may come my way

Theres no doubt that i will get there im certain
Nothings imposible
with dedication, Motivation desperation
We were all born to shine
and right nows my time
to give out a little light
of my own
And shine it on the world
 can fly high
and i can swim right under the ocean
anythings mine
If i have faith i kno i can do it
I will get by
If i work towards all my dreams
Suns gonna shine
if i have faith i know i can make it

All i need is faith
All i need is faith
All i need is faith
All i need is faith

I can fly high
and i can swim right under the ocean
anythings mine
If i have faith i kno i can do it
I will get by
If i work towards all my dreams
Suns gonna shine
if i have faith i know i can make it
