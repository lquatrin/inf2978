Listen to me I'm feeling afraid
Of something in my life that is wrong
And don't try tell me that I'm OK
Don't worry because I am strong
I know it gets hard sometimes
But remember that I'm only human
And the things that I face are the
Same things that you can help me to over come

I don't want nobody else
I don't need somebody else
To tell me about love
I am strong on my own
But if you think you can tell me
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong
Its just me getting stronger

Well I'm gonna tell you that I'm OK
That with or without you I'm the same
But don't get me wrong I'm still waiting for the day
When we can say we went all the way
Life is about all the meaningful things
That we get to share with each other
So leave the past behind and each other
We'll find our love is strong again

I don't want nobody else
I don't need somebody else
To tell me about love
I am strong on my own
But if you think you can tell me
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong
Its just me getting stronger

I don't want nobody else
I don't need somebody else
To tell me about love
I am strong on my own
But if you think you can tell me
Why the things I'm doing is going wrong
Its just me getting stronger

Its just me getting stronger [2x]
