(Verse One)

Memories, in my head
i just cant stop thinkin
about you
your not here with me
darlin i dont know what to do
never thought that this could ever be

(Chorus)
Oh i feel that im in love with you
please dont tell me
you dont feel the same
say you do
cos i cant take it
the essence of you
drives me crazy
i need you next to me
please say you do (please say you do)
please say you do (Please say you do)
please say you do....

(Verse Two)

Ooh
Every hour (Ooh)
all the time
i seem to look at a picture
of you
I know its been awhile
maybe you got a lady right now
but i gotta let you know
how i feel...

(Chorus)
Oh i feel that im in love with you
Please dont tell me
You dont feel the same
Say you do
Cos i cant take it
The essence of you
Drives me crazy
I need you next to me
Please say you do (please say you do)
Please say you do (Please say you do)
