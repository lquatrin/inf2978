And here I am again 
Crying 
Back again 
Trying to think clear 
But it's hard to see straight 
Through hasty heaping tears 

Please, let these be left-over tears 
Lost 
These have to be left-over tears 
They mustÂ… 

And there you were again 
Sitting 
On my couch again 
Hitting on my memories 
It used to be too small 
Now there's place enough for three 

(at least) 

Please, let these be left-over tears 
Lost 
These have to be left-over tears 
They mustÂ… 

These have to be left-over tears 
They just mustÂ… 
Please, let these be left-over tears 
Lost 

And there I am again 
Swearing
