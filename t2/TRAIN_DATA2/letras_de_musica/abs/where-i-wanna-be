Once again, yeah, oh oh

Tell me where your from girl your looking so down
Cause I ain't never seen nobody looking so fine
Gotta let me know where it's at - like woah
Cause she got it like that
Kinda let you know when I pass you
I wanna - kiss kiss - like the last dude
So lady let me know, if it's true (somebody told me)

Somebody said you was alone
That you ain't got no man at home
That you feeling for somebody
But you don't want just anybody - no no
Girl how about a little - ohw

A little bit of love from a rough neck, 
Get a hold to you, thats what I wanna do
A little bit of you in my ride, with the top down 
Wanna get you home got a touchdown
A little bit of front to the back, if you like that
From the side, if you never tried that
A little bit you on me, right here is where I wanna be

Verse 2 - let me flip this
Girl I be your freak any time of the week 
Cause the way you got ahold, girl it's so unique
I wanna take your body round we can cruise the town
You buy your body diamonds, tell me how you feeling now?
Said I like how you do when you dropping it right
Cause I like how you flow, you can call me tonight
That's cool, you know that's what I'm gonna do
But tell me girl, is it true...
