Oh My,

When I First Met You, 
I Bet You, 
Didn't Think It Would Get to a Situation Where I Bet You, 
Just Go, 
So Let It Let Me Know, 
Why Your're Acting Cold, 
Thinking About Words That You Told Me, 
When You Phoned Me, 
She Was Saying...

Nodesha: 
No, No, No! 
I'm Moving Into Something New, 
Saying Woah, Boy Slow, 
I've Got a Hundred Other Things T do Before I Go Just Tell Me...

Abs: 
Little Miss. Perfect Was She Worth It? 
Dangerous Game She Had to Play, 
She Coulda Deserted, But She Flirted, 
Now Little Miss. Perfect's Gone Away...

Both: 
Little Miss. Perfect Was She Worth It?

Abs: 
Ay, Oh No, 
Gonna do It Again, 
Gonna Find Myself, Right Back Up Where It Started, 
Baby Girl It Aint Hard to Tell, 
That You Wanna Get Your Flirt On, 
Coz You Got Your Boots and Your Skirt On, 
When Your Looking Like That, 
I Think I Want You Back...

Nodesha: 
No, No, No! 
Don't Even Try to Step to Me, 
Saying Woah, Boy Slow, 
Can't Stop This Curiosity, 
Before I Go Just Tell Me...
