Chorus:
You spin me right
Round baby right round,
Like a record baby right round round round.
You spin me right
Round baby right round,
Like a record baby right round round round.

It's what your doing to me, got me cross faded
I don't wanna sound conceited but I'm the best around,
The best when it comes to the you, check the mic 1,2
you like a melody playing on my mind, gotta get you lay it down. Harmonize the vocal.
In the words to describe you girl, you amazing
Everytime you pass me by, I'm star gazing.

Bridge:
Bump, bump bump, I got the bass if you got the jump,
To the funk, funk, funk, I write the beat, tell me what you want.
Cos I, I, I can't seem to take my eyes off you.
I try, try, try just no matter what I do, cos you

Chorus

Off again another 12" inch vinyl, clash of the classic
Y'all semi-final incredible, she got me so unstable
But I'm able when I'm on the turntable.
Mega, mega mix it down. DJ girl can't see, that it's just how I play, I can't deny.
I want her, change that, need her. SPS spin for many fever.
