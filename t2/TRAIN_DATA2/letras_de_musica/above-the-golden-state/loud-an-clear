IÂ’m not afraid to hear the silence
IÂ’m not afraid when IÂ’m alone
IÂ’ve seen a symphony of sunsets
I wanna know You as IÂ’m known
I can hear You loud and clear

YouÂ’re the song inside my head
The melody I canÂ’t forget
Louder than the world IÂ’m in
YouÂ’re the song IÂ’ve always heard
The instrument of grace throughout the universe
Louder than the world IÂ’m in

IÂ’m not afraid to look in darkness 
IÂ’m not afraid to loose control
I love how You orchestrate the sunrise from the starlight
Give me a song to call my own
I can hear You

YouÂ’re the song inside my head
The melody I canÂ’t forget
Louder than the world IÂ’m in
YouÂ’re the song IÂ’ve always heard
The instrument of grace across a fallen world
Louder than the world IÂ’m in

Life is an offering
Inside of this heartbeat
Today is a new song
Every verse is a new thought
Every breath is a chorus
My life is ascending
My life is ascending
