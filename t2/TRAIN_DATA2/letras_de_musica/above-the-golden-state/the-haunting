Stones throw away
I can see His agony
Start to bleed
Stones throw away
I can hear His adamant plea
Â“Let it pass from meÂ”

Save Lord, I pray
Save me from my enemy
Who prowls in deep
IÂ’ll fight to stay awake
My spirit wills, my flesh is weak
So I fall asleep

The dark is creeping in
How suddenly my vanity 
Betrays my speech
Â“This man is not my friendÂ”
What a foolish lie 
Â‘Cause You I canÂ’t deny Your mercy haunts me every night 
In a dream

Stones throw away
I can hear my SaviorÂ’s plea
Â“Come to meÂ”
IÂ’ve tried to run away
Why does He keep on asking me?
For my loyalty

My world is closing in
How suddenly my frailty 
Finds words to speak
IÂ’ll love You to the end
Until I die cause
You I canÂ’t deny Your mercy haunts me every night 
In a dream

I need You now
IÂ’m lost without You here
Forgive me all the times IÂ’ve turned away
My love is only Yours
IÂ’ve told You twice before
You I canÂ’t deny Your mercy haunts me every night 
In a dream

The world is closing in
Jesus, YouÂ’re my everything
My life to breath
IÂ’ll follow you
Until I reach the end
Â‘Til Your kingdom comes
Â‘Cause You I canÂ’t deny Your mercy haunts me every night 
In a dream

IÂ’ll follow You until I reach the end
