When I was yet unformed
You saw me and my days were numbered
You formed me
When I was in the dark
You searched me every part turned over
You found whatÂ’s inside of my heart

Where can I go
If I want to be alone?
I turn and Your there
Now IÂ’m gonna let it out 
All I know
Is Your mercy surrounds me 
Your thoughts for me outnumber the sand
Now IÂ’m gonna sing it out
From my soul 
Only You understand me
YouÂ’re holding me inside Your hands

From the moment I was born
You tried me and You made me stronger
I remember when You let me take control
So I would wonder
Who I am and who IÂ’m under
You broke me
To show me who You are 

Outside cut into my inside
You wonÂ’t stop Â‘til You find
The pride in my head, in my head
Inside You can give me one mind
Press me Â‘til I rewind
Into Your hands, into Your hands
