I lift my eyes to behold Your beauty
I can feel Your heavenly pull
You meet my eyes, with Your love enfold me
To rest upon, the gaze of my soul

In front of me is the figure I long for
I will turn to see no one else
IÂ’m consumed by Your grace and wonder
IÂ’m finding You as I loose myself
IÂ’m finding You as I loose myself

I, I wanna gaze into Your eyes
I wanna loose my soul in You
When I stare into Your eyes
I can see You looking back at me

The definition of my faith is a wonder
IÂ’d rather look to You than know
Lord, I believe and feel You moving
When I love with the love YouÂ’ve shown

The distractions of this world have trapped me
IÂ’m returning to the rest IÂ’ve known
As a bird flies away and wanders
Returning to my heavenly home
Returning to my heavenly home

I, my eyes are You
I can see You looking
I can see You looking back
