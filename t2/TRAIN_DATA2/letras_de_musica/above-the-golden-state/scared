I am scared
I'm afraid
Mercy me
With Your grace
My heart said in brokenness
I want to see Your face
Don't You hide
Don't You leave
Don't You turn
Away from me

Â‘Cause if You go I'll be forsaken
Who will be my souls salvation

Lord, hear my cry, hear my heart
Here I come to where You are
I'll be there for You
You'll be there for me
Lord, though I'm weak, You are strong
So I'll go back where I belong
And You'll be there for me
I'll be there for You
You'll be there for me

Answer me
In my place
You told me
To seek Your face
My heart spoke with heaviness
Your face I will seek
Don't give up
Don't forget
Remember me
I won't quit
What good am I if I'm not taken
And who am I without salvation
