I donÂ’t want to live
For anything but You
Jesus
And all I have to give
I give it all to You
Jesus
Every breath I breathe
I breathe for You
Jesus
And every word IÂ’ll speak
IÂ’ll speak for You
Jesus

With all my heart
And all my soul
I love You Lord
More and more
With all my mind
And all my strength
Take my life
