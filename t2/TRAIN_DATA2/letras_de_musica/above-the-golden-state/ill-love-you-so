I feel the sun
ItÂ’s returned again
To chase the cold
Far away
IÂ’m not alone
To fight the world IÂ’m in
You gave me hope
For better days

I was searching for a friend like no other
I never thought YouÂ’d come my way

Everything I give to You
IÂ’ll love You so
Everything I say or do
IÂ’ll love You so

Look where weÂ’ve come
How could I ever forget
Before Your love
My heart was dead
I was afraid
That my sun would set
But You stayed around
To lift my head

I was living my whole life undercover
Never dreamed IÂ’d see Your face
