Our cult is eternal
We sworn our legiance to
The horned uppergod
We are immortal

Abrasax hail our cult
Abrasax hail our lord

Sworn to secrecy
When you join us in the black
There is no turning back
Well formed in sourcery

Abrasax we will crush everybody
Abrasax let's feast with our lord
Our black ten commandments
Written in blood on human skin
This is the highest law
Kneel for abrasax

Abrasax hail to the eternal cult
Abrasax hail to all black souls
