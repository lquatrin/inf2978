When the cows of the peasants choke
When young children never returned from the dark woods
When future mothers gave birth to a dead baby

REMEMBER ME!

I was the innocent victim
my only crime was not to participate in your civilization
torture was my companion for hours
my body burned raped and pierced

REMEMBER ME?

When my spirit left my burned and abused body
I decided to become what was your accusition
I sold my soul to the evil one
now you can prey to your pityfull god

REMEMBER ME?

I shall Torment you forever
no one will know it it's my vengeance
jan The Burnt Warlock

REMEMBER ME!
