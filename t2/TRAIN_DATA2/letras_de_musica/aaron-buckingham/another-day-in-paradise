She calls out to the man on the street
"sir, can you help me?
It´s cold and i´ve nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn´t look back
He pretends he can´t hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrased to be there

Oh, think twice
Cause it´s just another day for you 'm me in paradise
Oh, think twice
Cause it´s just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she´s been crying
She´s got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can´t walk but she´s trying

Oh, think twice...

Just think about it

Oh, lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she´s been there
Probably been moved on from every place
´cause she didn´t fit in there

Oh, think twice...

It´s just another day
For you and me in paradise
