You are good, You are good Always good to us
You are good, You are good Always good to us
Even in tears, You're always good to us
Even in weeping You're always good to us
You could be anything You want

You, you're nothing less than beautiful
You, you're more than words define
You, you're nothing less than beautiful
Our God, you're marvelous and kind
