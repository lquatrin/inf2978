I hear the Savior say, Â“Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.Â”

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

For nothing good have I , Whereby Thy grace to claim,
IÂ’ll wash my garments white In the blood of CalvÂ’ryÂ’s Lamb.

And now complete in Him My robe His righteousness,
Close sheltered Â’neath His side, I am divinely blest.

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leperÂ’s spots And melt the heart of stone.

When from my dying bed My ransomed soul shall rise,
Â“Jesus died to my soul to save,Â” Shall rend the vaulted skies.

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
IÂ’ll lay my trophies down All down at JesusÂ’ feet

And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete
Â“Jesus died my soul to save,Â” my lips shall still repeat

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
