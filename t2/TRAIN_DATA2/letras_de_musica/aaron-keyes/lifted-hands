You are Creator God, Eternal, Forever
You are the Mighty God, So worthy
Your thoughts towards your people
Are the number of the oceanÂ’s sands
So I come rejoicing Before You with lifted hands

Lord I bless You, Lord I praise You
In spite of how I feel, I claim You
Lord I need You, I receive You
Lord I want You, Lord I Thank You, and I lift my hands

You are a Caring God, Protector, Provider
You are a Loving God, Wonderful

Your thoughts towards your people
Are the number of the stars in the sky
Your heart beats for your children
And Father, that is why (I bless YouÂ…)
