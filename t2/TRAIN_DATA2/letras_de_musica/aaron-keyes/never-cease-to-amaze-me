You never cease to amaze me, You work in wonderful mystery
You cover me with your mercy, You never stop amazing me
You were Exalted in majesty, You Came down in humility
Broke chains and made me free, You never cease to amaze me

V1
All praise to him who saves
Who conquered death and Scorned the grave
The priceless treasure freely spent
Has purchased grace that knows no end
To him we sing now, All in awe

V2
My dear RedeemerÂ’s throne
Is over all, He reigns alone
His ways are high, His thoughts are vast,
Our God, Our help in ages past
To him we sing now, All in awe
