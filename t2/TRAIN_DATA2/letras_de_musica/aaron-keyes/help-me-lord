Help me Lord, I canÂ’t see
What you have in store for me
Even though all seems dark
Help me Lord, to trust your heart

I am tired, I am weak
Are you listening to me
You seem so far, Far from here
Now I need you to be near

I throw myself into your arms
resting in tenderness and love
You are the Lord, I bow to you
And I will always follow you

Hold me close, Holy One
Let your loving comfort come
Help me pray like your Son
Not my will but yours be done
