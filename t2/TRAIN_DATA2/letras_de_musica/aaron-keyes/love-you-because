Lord I cry, Â“MaranathaÂ”, Lord I sing, Â“HallelujahÂ”
Lord You are higher than exalted, Where You are is where I want to be
I lift my eyes to your Throne
I lift my voice to You alone in worship, in worship

And You turn your ear to me, draw near to me
Hold me when I am in need
And my lips will sing your praise, my heartÂ’s been set ablaze
The glory of your face will I see
ItÂ’s all because of You Lord Jesus Christ, in all that I do, in all of my life
IÂ’ll worship You, IÂ’ll honor You, IÂ’ll love You because You first loved me

Now YouÂ’re there in the splendor of your holiness
Hear this prayer, Father grant my one request
For this child, who one day soon weÂ’ll see face to face
Take and guide, and shower down your sweet, sweet grace
I spread my hands before your throne
I live my life for You alone, as worship, as worship
