Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now IÂ’m found
Was blind but now I see so clearly

Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away

Â‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

When weÂ’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
WeÂ’ve no less days to sing Your praise
Than when we first begun
