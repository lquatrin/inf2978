I want to be like Jesus, I want to do the things he does
I want to look like Jesus, Show the world there's a God above who loves us
There's a God above who loves us

Everything I say and do, everything I am
Living now to worship You with everything I can
You're the only hope we have
You're the greatest joy we know
My life, your love to show

I want to be like Jesus, I want to do the things he does
I want to look like Jesus, Show the world there's a God above who loves us
There's a God above who loves us

Lord I want to think and speak, be and do
Everything and only that which pleases you
So come take control,
Suggest this day
All I design, do, or say
