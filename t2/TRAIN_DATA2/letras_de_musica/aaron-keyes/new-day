It's a new day, In the light of dawn the darkness fades away, away
It's a new day, Colors warming, hope is on display, today

I know there's beauty in the rhythm
I know there's dark before the light
I know that scars are part of healing
I'll be alright

It's a new day, grace is here today
I wake and find my shame washed away
Dancing in the dawn of a new day *(DÂ—E Turnaround)

It's a new day, your mercy's falling down on me like rain, like rain
It's a new day, Spirit breathing life I can't contain, cannot contain

You are forever and unchanging
You are the bright and morning star
You are my Generous Redeemer
It's who You are
