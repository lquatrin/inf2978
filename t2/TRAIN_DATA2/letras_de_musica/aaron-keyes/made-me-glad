I will bless the Lord forever, I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all fears, He has set my feet upon a rock

I will not be moved, IÂ’ll say of the Lord

You are my Shield, My Strength, my portion, Deliverer
My Shelter, Strong Tower, My very present help (in time of need)

Whom have I in heaven but You? ThereÂ’s none I desire beside You

You have made me glad, and IÂ’ll say of the Lord

BRIDGEÂ…
You have made me glad, and IÂ’ll say of the LordÂ…
