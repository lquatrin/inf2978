WeÂ’ve come to worship tonight, letÂ’s lift our hands lift them high
WeÂ’ve come to celebrate life, We are the body of Christ
My God is worthy of praise, My God is Ancient of Days
My God is here and He reigns, We will forever be changed

Sing unto the Lord (Glory to God), Praise Your Savior(Glory to God)
I will praise the Lord(Glory to God)
I will praise my God his love endures forever

2. Our God is faithful and true, Our God is reaching to You
Our God is here in this place, Our God is pouring out grace
Our God is Jesus alive, Our God exalted on high
Our God is coming again, He will deliver us then

3. Jesus You have set us free, Jesus You sing over me
You take delight in your sons, You are my only One
My praises now I bring, These songs to You I sing
Accept my offering, You are my Lord and King
Jesus You have set us free, Jesus You sing over me
You take delight in your sons, You are my only One
My praises now I bring, These songs to You I sing
Accept my offering, You are my Lord and King

Sing unto the Lord (Glory to God), Praise Your Savior(Glory to God)
I will praise the Lord(Glory to God)
I will praise my God his love endures forever
