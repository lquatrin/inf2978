Is there anyone here, Does anyone know
Can anyone feel the touch of the love of God
Has any eye seen, Has any heart changed
Can anyone stand in praise, Can anyone stand and say

Your love is a raging fire
Your touch is a soothing rain
Your kindness has turned my heart
And I am changed
Your mercy's a river wide
Your cross is an open door
Your blood says I'm justified
And I am yours

So who will declare the glory of God
So who will cry out, unashamed, Â“He is gloriousÂ”
'Til every eye sees, 'Till every heart knows
Let everyone stand in praise, Everyone stand and say
