Belle:
Yes, I made the choice
For papa, I will stay
But I don't deserve to to lose my freedom in this way 
You monster!
If you think that what you've done is right, well then 
You're a fool!
Think again!
Is this home?
Is this where I should learn to be happy?
Never dreamed
That a home could be dark and cold
I was told
Ev'ry day in my childhood:
Even when you grow old
Home should be where the heart is
Never where words so true!
My heart's far, far away
Home is too
Is this home
Is this what I must learn to believe in
Try to find
Something good in this tragic place
Just in case
I should stay here forever
Held in this empty place
Oh, that won't be easy
I know the reason why
My heart's far, far away
Home's alike
What I'd give to return
To the life that I knew lately
But I know now I can't
All my problems going by
Is this home?
Am I here for a day or forever?
Shut away
From the world until who knows when
Oh, but then
As my life has been altered once
It can change again
Build higher walls around me
Change ev'ry lock and key
Nothing lasts, nothing holds
All of me
My heart's far, far away
Home and free!
