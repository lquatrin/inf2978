Belle:
Little town
It's a quiet village
Ev'ry day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say:
Townsfolk:
Bonjour!
Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!
Belle:
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Ev'ry morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Baker:
Good Morning, Belle!
Belle:
Good morning, Monsieur.
Baker:
And where are you off to, today?
Belle: 
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a -
Baker: That's nice. Marie! The baguettes!
Hurry up! 
Townsfolk:
Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question 
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Woman:
Never part of any crowd
Man:
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
Townsfolk:
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle
Man I:
Bonjour!
Woman I:
Good day!
Man I:
How is your fam'ly?
Woman 2:
Bonjour!
Man 2:
Good day!
Woman 2:
How is your wife?
Woman 3:
I need six eggs!
Woman 4:
That's too expensive!
Belle:
There must be more than this provincial life!
Bookseller:
Ah, Belle.
Belle:
Good morning, sir. I've come to return the book I borrowed.
Bookseller:
Finished already?
Belle:
Oh, I couldn't put it down. Have you got anything new?
Bookseller: 
Not since yesterday.
Belle:
That's all right. I'll borrow . . . . this one!
Bookseller: 
That one? But you've read it twice!
Belle:
Well, it's my favorite! Far off places, daring
swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise -
Bookseller:
If you like it all that much, it's yours! 
Belle:
But sir!
Bookseller:
I insist.
Belle:
Thank you. Thank you very much!
Townsfolk:
Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Belle:
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my fav'rite part because --- you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!
Woman:
Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
Shopkeeper:
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Man:
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
Townsfolk:
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!
LeFou: I got it Gaston! Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world! 
Gaston:
I know.
LeFou:
No beast alive stands a chance against you. --- 
And no girl, for that matter.
Gaston:
It's true, LeFou. And I've got
my sights set on that one.
LeFou:
The inventor's daughter?
Gaston:
She's the one - the lucky girl
I'm going to marry. 
LeFou:
But she's -
Gaston:
The most beautiful girl in town.
LeFou:
I know, but -
Gaston:
That makes her the best. And don't
I deserve the best?
LeFou:
Of course you do!
Gaston:
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle
Bimbettes:
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute! 
Woman 1:
Bonjour!
Gaston:
Pardon
Belle:
Good day
Woman 2:
Mais oui!
Woman 3:
You call this bacon?
Woman 4:
What lovely grapes!
Man 1:
Some cheese
Woman 5:
Ten yards!
Man 1:
one pound
Gaston:
'scuse me!
Cheese merchant:
I'll get the knife
Gaston:
Please let me through!
Woman 6:
This bread -
Woman 7:
Those fish -
Woman 6:
it's stale!
Woman 7:
they smell!
Men:
Madame's mistaken.
Women:
Well, maybe so
Townsfolk:
Good morning! Oh, good morning!
Belle:
There must be more than this provincial life!
Gaston:
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!
Townsfolk:
Look there she goes
The girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mad'moiselle!
Women:
It's a pity and a sin
Men:
She doesn't quite fit in
Townsfolk:
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!
