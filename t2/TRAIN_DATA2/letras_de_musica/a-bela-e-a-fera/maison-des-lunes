Gaston:
There's a danger I'll be thwarted
And denied my honeymoon
For the pretty thing I've courted
Refuse to swoon
So, the time has come for a murky plan
For which I turn to a murky man
LeFou:
To find that feind
Both:
Where better than
The Maison des Lunes?
Gaston:
I don't take this girl for granted
There's no path I haven't hewn
To her heart; no seed unplanted
No flowers unstrewn
But quite amazing to relate
She doesn't want me for her mate
LeFou:
Which forces him to contemplate
Both:
The Maison des Lunes
Monsieur D'Arque:
I don't wish to seem a tad obtuse
But I don't see how I can be of use
For I lock people up; I'm not a "Lonely Heart's club" 
I'm a cold, cold fish
I've a nasty, vicious streak
LeFou:
Please speak!
Gaston:
It's Belle's father who's your client
She adores the old buffoon
She'll be forced to be complaint
LeFou:
She'll dance to your tune
Gaston:
We get the daughter through her dad
You just pronounce the old boy mad
LeFou:
And, whoosh! He's slammed up in your pad--
LeFou, D'Arque:
The Maison des Lunes
Gaston:
Do I make myself entirely clear?
D'Arque:
It's the simplest deal of my whole foul career!
Gaston:
Put Maurice away and she'll be here in moments
In a dreadful state
She'll capitulate to me!
D'Arque:
I'll be strapping up an inmate
LeFou:
Very tightly
Gaston:
Very soon
D'Arque:
But please don't bring him late
Our check-in time's noon!
LeFou, D'Arque:
So, wave one bachelor goodbye
Gaston:
She'll be my bride
LeFou:
She'd rather die
Than have her daddy ossify?
D'Arque:
In my sordid saloon
All:
So book the church; raise the glasses high
To the Maison des Lunes!
