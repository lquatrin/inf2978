Beast: 
You came back
Belle:
If only I'd come here sooner
Beast: 
Maybe it's better this way
Belle:
No! Don't talk like that. We're together now. 
Everything will be fine
Beast: 
At least I get to see you one last time.
Belle:
We are home
We are where we shall be forever
Trust in me
For you know I wont run away
From today
This is all that I need
And all that I need to say is...
Don't you know how you've changed me
Strange how I fin'lly see
I found home
You're my home
Stay with me
Belle: 
No! No, please! Don't leave me!
I love you.

Prince:
Belle, look into my eyes!
Belle, don't you recognize
The beast within the man
Who's here before you?
Belle:
It is you!
