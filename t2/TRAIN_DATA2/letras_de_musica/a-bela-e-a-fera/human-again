Lumiere:
Ha ha, we, my friends.
The day we have waited for may be at hand!
Mrs. Potts: 
Oh, only if that were true,
Lumiere!
Lumiere:
Aaah...human again
Mrs. Potts: 
Human again
Lumiere: 
Yes, think of what that means!
Lumiere:
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm...
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Mrs. Potts:
Which should cause sev'ral husbands alarm!
Chip:
I'll hop down off the shelf
Lumiere:
And toute suite be myself
Chip:
I can't wait to be human again
Mme. De La Grande Bouche, Mrs. Potts, Babette:
When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks and whatnots no more
Chip:
Little push, little shove
They coul, whoosh fall in love
Mme. De La Grande Bouche:
Ah, cherie, won't it all be top-drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savior-faire
I'll wear gowns! I'll have hair!
It's my prayer to be human again
Cogsworth:
When I'm human again
Only human again
When the world once more making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Lumiere:
Really? That'd be strange!
Cogsworth:
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fool made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks and relax
All:
When I'm human again
So sweep the dust from the floor!
Let's let some light in the room!
I can feel, I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now!
Lumiere/Babette:
Shine up the brass on the door!
Alert the dustpail and the broom!
All:
If all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now!
Mrs. Potts, Egg Timer, Whisk:
Open the shutters and let in some air
Mrs. Potts:
Put these here and put those over there
All:
Sweep up the years
Of sadness and tears
And throw them away!
Belle:
When Guen√®vire heard that Arthur was slain, 
she went away to a convent, and no one could 
make her smile again. The end.
Beast:
What a beautiful story
Belle:
Oh, I knew you would like it! 
I would like to ask you something
Beast:
What's that?
Belle:
A second chance. Would you have dinner with me tonight?
Beast: 
Huh? Me? You? Well, that would be,
I mean -- Oh, yes!!
All:
When we're human again
Only human again
When the girl fin'lly sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin' again
We're assumin' again
We'll resume our long lost joie de vie
We'll be playin' again
Holiday' again
And we're prayin' it's A-S-A-P
When we cast off this pall
We'll stand straight, we'll walk tall
When we're all that we were
Thanks to him, thanks to her
Coming closer and closer
And closer and...
We'll be dancing again!
We'll be twirling again!
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're fin'lly reborn
And we're all of us human again!
