Belle:
Papa, do you think I'm...odd?
Maurice:
My daughter odd? Where did you get an idea like that?
Belle:
I don't know. It's just that, well, people talk.
Maurice:
They talk about me, too.
Maurice:
No, we're not odd, its true
No fam'ly ever saner
Except one uncle who...well, maybe let that pass
In all you say or do
You couldn't make it plainer
You are your mother's daughter; therefore you are class
Belle:
So I should just accept
I'm simply not like them
Maurice:
They are the common herd
And you should take my word
You are unique: creme de la creme
No matter what you do
I'm on your side
And if my point of view
Is somewhat misty-eyed
There's nothing clearer in my life
Than what I wish and feel for you
And that's a lot...
No matter what
Belle:
No matter what they say
You make me proud
I love the funny way
You stand out from the crowd
Maurice:
It's my intention my invention
Shows the world out there one day
Just what we've got...
Belle:
No matter what
Maurice:
Now some may say all fathers just exaggerate
Belle:
That ev'ry daughter's great?
Maurice:
You are!
Belle:
And ev'ry daughter tends to say her father's tops
Maurice:
She pulls out all the stops
To praise him
Belle:
And quite rightly!
Maurice:
No matter what the pain
We've come this far
I pray that you remain
Exactly as you are
This really is a case of father knowing best
Belle:
And daughter too!
Maurice:
You're never strange
Belle:
Don't ever change
Both:
You've all I've got
No matter what.
