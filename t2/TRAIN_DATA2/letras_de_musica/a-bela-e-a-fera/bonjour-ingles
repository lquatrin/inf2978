The same old bread and rolls to sell.
Every morning just the same since the morning that we came,
To this poor provential town.

About a beanstalk and an ogor and an...

That's alright. I'll borrow...this one!

[Book Shop Clerk]
That one?! But you've read it twice!

[Belle]
Well it's my favorite! Far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise!

[Book Shop Clerk] 
Well if you like it all that much, it's yours.

[Belle]
But sir!

[Book Shop Clerk]
I insist.

[Belle]
Well thank you! Thank you very much!

[Group Of Women]
With a dreaming for a look.

[Group Of Men]
And her nose stuck in a book.

[Villigers]
What a puzzle to the rest of us, that's Belle.

[Belle]
Oh! Isn't this amazing? It's my favorite because you'll see. Here's where she meets prince charming. But she won't discover
that it's him till chapter three.

[Woman #3]
Well It's no wonder that her name means beauty, her looks have got no parallel.

[Man #1]
Very different from the rest of us.

[Villigers]
She's nothing like the rest of us. Yes different from the rest of us is Belle.

[Lafue]
Wow! You didn't miss a shot Gaston! Your the greatest hunter in the whole world.

[Gaston]

[Lafue]
No beast alive stands a chance against you. And no girl for that matter.

[Gaston]
It's true Lafue. And I've got my sights set on the one.

[Lafue]
The inventors daughter?!

[Gaston]
She's the one! The luky girl I'm going to marry!

[Lafue]
But shes...

[Gaston]
The most beautiful girl in town. That makes her the best! And don't I deserve the best!?

[Lafue] 
Well of corse, I mean you do, I mean...

[Gaston]
Right from the moment when i met her, saw her, I said she's gorgeous and I fell...in a gal as old as she, who is beautiful
as me. So I'm making plans to rule and marry Belle.

[Gaston Groupies]
Look there he goes, isn't he dreamy? Misure Gaston, oh he's so cute!
Bestill my heart, I'm hardly breathing. He's such a strong, tall, dark, and handsome brute.
