And the stars burn for me
And the night is my only friend
I should rule this
I'm the master of so many men
So lonely
Been alone for too many years
So wretched
To suffer the mortal man's fears

This world was made to mock me
The human race has damned me
I become the lies they speak

Won't you join me in my anguish
Won't you comfort me in this abyss
Desire of me, satisfy me, I'm yours
Crucify me like the one that you love

I'll watch this world burn
I'll watch this world burn

Won't you join me in my anguish
Won't you comfort me in this abyss
Desire of me, satisfy me, I'm yours
Crucify me like the one that you love

And the stars burn for me
And the night is my only friend
I should rule this
I'm the master of so many men
So lonely
Been alone for too many years
So wretched
To suffer the mortal man's fears
