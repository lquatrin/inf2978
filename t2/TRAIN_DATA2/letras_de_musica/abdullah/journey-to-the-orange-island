This mystic voyage
Transcending space and time
This journey ends within my mind

All thoughts turn inward
Enter this world sublime
Where I exist within my mind

And the laws of the earth mean nothing to those
Who leave this world far behind
And the words that I speak are my own again
When I leave this all fall behind

This mystic voyage
Transcending space and time
This journey ends within my mind

All thoughts turn inward
Enter this world sublime
Where I exist within my mind

And the laws of the earth mean nothing to those
Who leave this world far behind
And the words that I speak are my own again
When I leave this all fall behind
