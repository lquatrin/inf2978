All of the longing
Condensed in this place and time
I invoke you, O spirits, crawl inside
Then awaken my conscience
Lain dormant for all this time
And feed the despair that pervades my life, yeah

In the hold of a nightmare
I see truth in their words and lies
And beauty appears in sorrow's guise
So caught in the moment
We ignore the passing of time
And mistake the empty for the sublime, yeah

Oh, my savior
Give value to these misdeeds
In sin you bathe me
Holy
So I say that the father lies
And my dreams will betray me tonight

Obey the scourge of night
May darkness bring sight
I welcome your grace
Upon this night

All of the longing
And thoughts scribed in soothing fire
The ashes and smoke breed my desire
Abject and misshapen
To you I give all that I'm worth
My swarthy children of the earth, yeah

Oh, can these words be given shape
Oh, does the fool acknowledge fate
I've awaken the monster
The one that exists in my mind
In fear I behold the apparent divine
It grants me one vision
The mother in death giving birth
To the swarthy children of the earth, yeah

Oh, our savior
Pour deep within me
In blackness forsake me
Holy

So I say that the father lies
And my dreams will betray me tonight, yeah

Breathe slightly
Sleep soundly
All through this night
Breathe slightly
Sleep soundly
All through this night

I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall
I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall
I'm under its spell
I am too small
To try to resist the Ancient One's call
Will you be with me when I fall
