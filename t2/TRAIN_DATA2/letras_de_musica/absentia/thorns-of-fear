Lure me away
Closer to the thorns
My sins I whisper
My brain is so cold

I stand upon my road again
There is where my soul is lying
In my cage of life where I have my sanity

My madness is filling te hole in my cage
Brain boiling with ideas, I feel but pain for you

Fear!
Thorns of fear!
Fear!
Thorns of fear!
Rips my mind and I see it fall

The road of my mind lies beneath the rocks of pain
Dreams are showing me my thorns of fear
The wind is shattering fingers of leaves from the thorns
Thorns of fear and I see it fall from here

When the road is over so is my sense of you
Suddenly I see us dance in the garden of madness
You look like my mind, by the thorns I see my life
Needles are going through my body without a sound

I cry for the pain of being amongst the living
Six feet under, in the ground my life begins all over again

I feel the thorns
The road where I died
My mind is gone
I turn and close my eyes
