I walk along the garden
A place I don't recall
I dream about a figure
A voice surrounding all
Weeping willows standing tall
I try to reach up but I desperately fall
I travel towards a sealed destination
Heading for a new creation

Be as you want to be
See what you want to see
Awake my love
Next to me?

She was a heathen
Where she is - lies Eden
The serpent smiled - an apple fell
He had her under a wicked spell

Be as you want to be
See what you want to see
Awake my love
Next to me
