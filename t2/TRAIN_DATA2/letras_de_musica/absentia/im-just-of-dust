I breathe on your breast,
Even the orchid sounds
Like lions in my head
Your love has put me
Into the spiders lullaby.

Dive into the sea
Where love will put thee...
Your fear of me grows
With your lust.
But, oh, fear me not
I am just of dust.

Fear me not,
I'm just of dust

I sink into your being
Lustful tears of feelings.
Greet me to be,
Forever with thee...
Let me be
Forever in your heart.

Fear me not,
I'm just of dust
