I praise what is unfamiliar
I adore what is unknown
I'd love to see you dance
Under the darkest nights...

Falling
into the serpents garden
with the blessing of God
Seeking
lifes true meaning
In the light of darkest nights

Under
moonlit skies we dance
In praise of feeble delights
Oh, my dear beuty
Your my angel, my sin,
my everything

The stars will paint their faces
When the two of them becomes one
Seeking lifes true meaning
In the light of the brightest suns

Sunrise
A day will grow again
We wonder, in thought
we are lost
Dreaming back to tomorrow
And darkest arabian nights...

Under
moonlit skies we dance
In praise of feeble delights
Oh, my dear beuty
Your my angel, my sin,
my everything
