Desolation of consistency
The dreading delusion
A wandering intellect
Losing the contact

Rage is emancipation
From craven judgment
Demise the respond
Hitherto mind slipping

Feelings grow apart
From visions of grief
To views of sadness
The utter salvation
My irritation now suppressed
To calm my vehemence
And reinstate in silence
My rebirth forever lost
Very thought of anger
Not considered obligatory
Toward me my mind
Need not hate any longer

Escape of resentment
To the elemental depression
Within my dismayed state
Of understanding I am not
