Macabre decisions
Horrid conditions
Abysmal confusion
An endless retribution
Distress of hopelessness
Terror of pending deceit
Scratching inside my soul
Reparation of deception

The acceptance of desolation
Reconcile within
A gloomy prospect
Of expectations to come
Feelings of anguish
Running in my skin
Coursing through my veins
Tearing me to pieces

This torture upon me
My mind escapes
Into feelings of aggression
Fear, pain and agony

Approach thoughts sadistic
Manner of dishonesty
Trifle my mind
So full of misery
